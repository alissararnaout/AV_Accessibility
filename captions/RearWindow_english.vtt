00:02:30.484 --> 00:02:32.151
Men, are you over 40?

00:02:32.236 --> 00:02:34.946
When you wake up in the morning,
do you feel tired and rundown?

00:02:35.030 --> 00:02:36.391
Do you have that listless feeling?

00:04:15.339 --> 00:04:16.339
Jefferies.

00:04:16.423 --> 00:04:17.548
<i>Congratulations, Jeff.</i>

00:04:17.633 --> 00:04:18.633
For what?

00:04:18.675 --> 00:04:20.384
<i>For getting rid of that cast.</i>

00:04:20.469 --> 00:04:22.428
Who said I was getting rid of it?

00:04:22.512 --> 00:04:23.971
<i>This is Wednesday.</i>

00:04:24.056 --> 00:04:27.850
<i>Seven weeks from the day you
broke your leg. Yes or no?</i>

00:04:28.936 --> 00:04:33.564
Gunnison, how did you ever get to be such
a big editor with such a small memory?

00:04:33.649 --> 00:04:35.608
<i>Thrift, industry and hard work.</i>

00:04:35.692 --> 00:04:38.778
<i>And catching the publisher
with his secretary.</i>

00:04:38.862 --> 00:04:39.862
<i>Did I get the wrong day?</i>

00:04:39.905 --> 00:04:41.614
No.

00:04:41.698 --> 00:04:43.449
No, wrong week.

00:04:43.533 --> 00:04:48.162
Next Wednesday I emerge
from this plaster cocoon.

00:04:48.246 --> 00:04:50.289
<i>That's too bad, Jeff.</i>

00:04:50.374 --> 00:04:53.167
<i>Well, I guess I can't be lucky every day.</i>

00:04:53.251 --> 00:04:54.585
<i>Forget I called.</i>

00:04:54.670 --> 00:04:57.964
Yeah, I sure feel sorry for you, Gunnison.

00:04:58.048 --> 00:05:01.676
Must be rough on you thinking of me
wearing this cast for another whole week.

00:05:01.760 --> 00:05:04.637
<i>That one week is gonna cost
me my best photographer</i>

00:05:04.721 --> 00:05:06.973
<i>and you a big assignment.</i>

00:05:07.057 --> 00:05:08.057
Where?

00:05:08.141 --> 00:05:09.850
<i>There's no point in even talking about it.</i>

00:05:09.935 --> 00:05:11.519
Oh, come on, come on. Where?

00:05:11.603 --> 00:05:13.145
<i>Kashmir.</i>

00:05:13.230 --> 00:05:15.856
<i>Got a code tip from the
bureau chief this morning.</i>

00:05:15.941 --> 00:05:17.692
<i>The place is about to go up in smoke.</i>

00:05:17.776 --> 00:05:20.576
What did I tell you? Didn't I tell
you that's the next place to watch?

00:05:20.612 --> 00:05:21.612
<i>You did.</i>

00:05:21.697 --> 00:05:24.031
Okay. When do I leave? Half-hour? Hour?

00:05:24.116 --> 00:05:26.325
<i>With that cast on? You don't.</i>

00:05:26.410 --> 00:05:28.661
Oh, stop sounding stuffy.

00:05:28.745 --> 00:05:32.623
I can take pictures from a jeep
or a water buffalo, if necessary.

00:05:32.708 --> 00:05:35.835
<i>You're too valuable to the magazine
for us to play around with.</i>

00:05:35.919 --> 00:05:37.753
<i>I'll send Morgan or Lambert.</i>

00:05:37.838 --> 00:05:39.755
Morgan or Lambert. That's fine.

00:05:40.632 --> 00:05:42.967
I get myself half-killed for you,

00:05:43.051 --> 00:05:45.594
and you reward me by
stealing my assignments.

00:05:45.679 --> 00:05:49.348
<i>I didn't ask you to stand in the
middle of that automobile racetrack.</i>

00:05:49.433 --> 00:05:53.978
You asked for something
dramatically different. You got it.

00:05:54.062 --> 00:05:56.480
<i>So did you. Goodbye, Jeff.</i>

00:05:56.565 --> 00:06:00.026
Now wait a minute, Gunnison.
You've got to get me out of here.

00:06:00.110 --> 00:06:02.570
Six weeks sitting in a two-room apartment

00:06:02.654 --> 00:06:04.864
with nothing to do but look out
the window at the neighbors.

00:06:04.948 --> 00:06:05.948
<i>Bye, Jeff.</i>

00:06:06.033 --> 00:06:07.366
No, Gunnison, I...

00:06:07.451 --> 00:06:10.244
If you don't pull me out
of this swamp of boredom,

00:06:10.328 --> 00:06:12.163
I'm gonna do something drastic.

00:06:12.247 --> 00:06:13.247
<i>Like what?</i>

00:06:13.290 --> 00:06:14.373
"Like what"? I'm gonna get married.

00:06:14.458 --> 00:06:16.709
And then I'll never be able to go anywhere.

00:06:16.793 --> 00:06:18.169
<i>It's about time you got married,</i>

00:06:18.253 --> 00:06:21.547
<i>before you turn into a
lonesome and bitter old man.</i>

00:06:22.799 --> 00:06:25.051
Yeah, can't you just see me?

00:06:26.386 --> 00:06:28.095
Rushing home to a hot apartment

00:06:28.180 --> 00:06:32.141
to listen to the automatic laundry
and the electric dishwasher

00:06:32.225 --> 00:06:36.937
and the garbage disposal
and the nagging wife.

00:06:37.022 --> 00:06:40.566
<i>Jeff, wives don't nag
anymore, they discuss.</i>

00:06:40.650 --> 00:06:43.235
Is that so? Is that so?

00:06:43.320 --> 00:06:45.905
Well, maybe in the high-rent
district they discuss.

00:06:45.989 --> 00:06:48.157
In my neighborhood, they still nag.

00:06:48.241 --> 00:06:52.661
<i>Yeah? Well, you know best.
I'll call you later, Jeff.</i>

00:06:52.746 --> 00:06:55.748
Yeah, have some good
news the next time, huh?

00:07:49.469 --> 00:07:51.846
Good morning. I said, "Good morning"!

00:07:51.930 --> 00:07:53.722
Oh, good morning.

00:08:11.700 --> 00:08:14.535
Say, I wouldn't dig
so deep if I were you.

00:08:15.704 --> 00:08:18.330
You're giving them
far too much water.

00:08:19.708 --> 00:08:21.584
Why don't you shut up?

00:08:24.880 --> 00:08:26.088
Well!

00:08:28.425 --> 00:08:29.425
I do declare.

00:08:29.509 --> 00:08:33.345
New York State sentence for a Peeping
Tom is six months in the workhouse.

00:08:33.430 --> 00:08:34.972
Oh, hello, Stella.

00:08:35.056 --> 00:08:37.683
And they got no windows in the workhouse.

00:08:37.767 --> 00:08:41.770
You know, in the old days, they used to
put your eyes out with a red-hot poker.

00:08:41.855 --> 00:08:46.775
Any of those bikini bombshells you're
always watching worth a red-hot poker?

00:08:46.860 --> 00:08:50.905
Oh, dear. We've become a
race of Peeping Toms.

00:08:51.656 --> 00:08:55.868
What people ought to do is get outside
their own house and look in for a change.

00:08:55.952 --> 00:08:57.286
Yes, sir.

00:08:57.370 --> 00:08:59.496
How's that for a bit
of homespun philosophy?

00:08:59.581 --> 00:09:01.999
Reader's Digest, April, 1939.

00:09:02.125 --> 00:09:04.251
- Well, I only quote from the best.
- Yeah.

00:09:04.336 --> 00:09:06.545
You don't have to take my
temperature this morning.

00:09:06.630 --> 00:09:09.381
Quiet. See if you can break 100.

00:09:09.466 --> 00:09:11.884
You know, I should have
been a gypsy fortune-teller

00:09:11.968 --> 00:09:14.053
instead of an
insurance-company nurse.

00:09:14.137 --> 00:09:18.432
I got a nose for trouble.
Can smell it ten miles away.

00:09:18.516 --> 00:09:22.895
You heard of that market crash in '29?
I predicted that.

00:09:22.979 --> 00:09:25.105
Just how did you do that, Stella?

00:09:25.190 --> 00:09:26.482
Oh, simple.

00:09:26.566 --> 00:09:30.069
I was nursing a director
of General Motors.

00:09:30.153 --> 00:09:34.281
"Kidney ailment," they said.
"Nerves," I said.

00:09:34.366 --> 00:09:38.535
Then I asked myself, "What's General
Motors got to be nervous about?"

00:09:39.496 --> 00:09:42.790
"Overproduction", I says. "Collapse".

00:09:42.874 --> 00:09:46.460
When General Motors has to go
to the bathroom 10 times a day,

00:09:46.544 --> 00:09:49.088
the whole country's
ready to let go.

00:09:50.799 --> 00:09:52.424
You know, Stella, in economics,

00:09:52.509 --> 00:09:55.219
a kidney ailment has no
relationship to the stock market.

00:09:55.303 --> 00:09:56.470
None whatsoever.

00:09:56.554 --> 00:09:58.597
Crashed, didn't it?

00:09:58.682 --> 00:10:01.725
I can smell trouble right
here in this apartment.

00:10:01.810 --> 00:10:06.397
First you smash your leg, then you
get to looking out the window,

00:10:06.481 --> 00:10:09.149
see things you shouldn't see.
Trouble.

00:10:10.610 --> 00:10:12.403
I can see you in court now,

00:10:12.487 --> 00:10:15.948
surrounded by a bunch of lawyers
in double-breasted suits.

00:10:16.032 --> 00:10:21.245
You're pleading. You say, "Judge, it
was only a little bit of innocent fun."

00:10:21.329 --> 00:10:24.331
"I love my neighbors,
like a father."

00:10:24.416 --> 00:10:26.458
And the judge says,
"Well, congratulations."

00:10:26.543 --> 00:10:29.878
"You've just given birth
to three years in Dannemora."

00:10:29.963 --> 00:10:32.631
Right now I'd welcome
trouble, you know.

00:10:32.716 --> 00:10:34.258
You've got a hormone deficiency.

00:10:34.342 --> 00:10:36.051
How can you tell
from a thermometer?

00:10:36.136 --> 00:10:38.053
Those bathing beauties
you've been watching

00:10:38.138 --> 00:10:41.598
haven't raised your temperature
one degree in a month.

00:10:44.436 --> 00:10:45.811
Here we go.

00:10:51.651 --> 00:10:53.360
One more week.

00:10:57.240 --> 00:11:00.242
No, I think you're right. I think there
is gonna be trouble around here.

00:11:00.327 --> 00:11:01.744
I knew it.

00:11:02.078 --> 00:11:03.120
Ooh!

00:11:03.204 --> 00:11:05.414
Do you ever heat that stuff?

00:11:05.498 --> 00:11:07.249
Gives your circulation
something to fight.

00:11:07.334 --> 00:11:08.334
Oh, I see.

00:11:08.418 --> 00:11:09.960
What kind of trouble?

00:11:10.045 --> 00:11:11.795
Lisa Fremont.

00:11:11.880 --> 00:11:13.088
You kidding?

00:11:13.173 --> 00:11:17.843
She's a beautiful young girl, and
you're a reasonably healthy young man.

00:11:17.927 --> 00:11:19.219
She expects me to marry her.

00:11:19.304 --> 00:11:20.346
That's normal.

00:11:20.430 --> 00:11:21.638
I don't want to.

00:11:21.723 --> 00:11:22.723
That's abnormal.

00:11:22.807 --> 00:11:25.434
I just... I'm not
ready for marriage.

00:11:25.518 --> 00:11:28.687
Every man's ready for marriage
when the right girl comes along.

00:11:28.772 --> 00:11:31.690
And Lisa Fremont is the right girl
for any man with half a brain

00:11:31.775 --> 00:11:33.192
who can get one eye open.

00:11:33.276 --> 00:11:34.860
She's all right.

00:11:34.944 --> 00:11:36.862
- What'd you do, have a fight?
- No.

00:11:36.946 --> 00:11:38.530
Father loading up the shotgun?

00:11:38.615 --> 00:11:39.656
What?

00:11:39.741 --> 00:11:40.908
Please, Stella.

00:11:40.992 --> 00:11:42.534
It's happened before, you know.

00:11:42.619 --> 00:11:44.161
Some of the world's
happiest marriages

00:11:44.245 --> 00:11:47.748
have started "under the
gun", as you might say.

00:11:47.832 --> 00:11:49.193
No, she's just not
the girl for me.

00:11:49.250 --> 00:11:50.417
Yeah, she's only perfect.

00:11:50.502 --> 00:11:55.506
She's too perfect. She's too talented. She's
too beautiful. She's too sophisticated.

00:11:55.590 --> 00:11:57.633
She's too everything
but what I want.

00:11:57.717 --> 00:12:01.095
Is what you want something
you can discuss?

00:12:01.179 --> 00:12:03.597
What? It's very
simple, Stella.

00:12:03.681 --> 00:12:07.768
She belongs to that rarefied
atmosphere of Park Avenue, you know.

00:12:07.852 --> 00:12:11.021
Expensive restaurants and
literary cocktail parties.

00:12:11.106 --> 00:12:13.148
People with sense belong
wherever they're put.

00:12:13.233 --> 00:12:16.151
Can you imagine her traveling
around the world with a camera bum

00:12:16.236 --> 00:12:18.320
who never has more than a
week's salary in the bank?

00:12:18.405 --> 00:12:21.073
If she was only ordinary.

00:12:21.825 --> 00:12:23.450
You never gonna get married?

00:12:23.535 --> 00:12:25.994
I'll probably get married
one of these days,

00:12:26.079 --> 00:12:28.539
but when I do, it's gonna be
to someone who thinks of life

00:12:28.623 --> 00:12:33.293
not just as a new dress
and a lobster dinner

00:12:33.378 --> 00:12:35.421
or latest scandal.

00:12:35.505 --> 00:12:38.507
I need a woman who's
willing to... Hold it.

00:12:38.591 --> 00:12:42.469
Who's willing to go anywhere
and do anything and love it.

00:12:43.263 --> 00:12:46.140
So the honest thing for me to do
is just call the whole thing off.

00:12:46.224 --> 00:12:48.225
Let her find somebody else.

00:12:48.309 --> 00:12:50.227
Yeah, I can hear you now.

00:12:50.311 --> 00:12:52.563
"Get out of my life, you
perfectly wonderful woman."

00:12:52.647 --> 00:12:54.314
"You're too
good for me."

00:12:54.399 --> 00:12:56.775
Look, Mr. Jefferies, I'm
not an educated woman,

00:12:56.860 --> 00:12:58.610
but I can tell you one thing.

00:12:58.695 --> 00:13:02.030
When a man and a woman see each
other and like each other,

00:13:02.115 --> 00:13:06.452
they ought to come together, wham,
like a couple of taxis on Broadway,

00:13:06.536 --> 00:13:10.747
and not sit around analyzing each
other like two specimens in a bottle.

00:13:10.832 --> 00:13:13.959
There's an intelligent way
to approach marriage.

00:13:14.043 --> 00:13:15.169
Intelligence.

00:13:15.253 --> 00:13:19.214
Nothing has caused the human race
so much trouble as intelligence.

00:13:19.299 --> 00:13:22.009
Modern marriage.

00:13:22.093 --> 00:13:24.636
No, we've progressed
emotionally.

00:13:24.721 --> 00:13:26.096
Baloney.

00:13:26.181 --> 00:13:29.516
Once it was, "See somebody,
get excited, get married."

00:13:30.560 --> 00:13:34.396
Now it's, "Read a lot of books, fence
with a lot of four-syllable words",

00:13:34.481 --> 00:13:36.231
"psychoanalyze each other"

00:13:36.316 --> 00:13:37.900
"until you can't tell
the difference between"

00:13:37.984 --> 00:13:41.987
"a petting party and
a civil service exam."

00:13:42.071 --> 00:13:44.531
People have different
emotional levels...

00:13:44.616 --> 00:13:48.494
When I married Myles, we were both
a couple of maladjusted misfits.

00:13:48.578 --> 00:13:53.999
We are still maladjusted misfits, and
we have loved every minute of it.

00:13:54.083 --> 00:13:55.123
Well, that's fine, Stella.

00:13:55.168 --> 00:13:57.169
Now, would you fix me
a sandwich, please?

00:13:57.253 --> 00:13:58.462
Yes, I will.

00:13:58.546 --> 00:14:01.423
And I'll spread a little
common sense on the bread.

00:14:01.508 --> 00:14:04.343
Lisa's loaded to her
fingertips with love for you.

00:14:04.427 --> 00:14:07.471
I got two words of advice for you.
Marry her.

00:14:07.555 --> 00:14:08.805
She pay you much?

00:14:08.890 --> 00:14:09.932
Oh!

00:14:26.783 --> 00:14:28.325
There.

00:14:32.413 --> 00:14:34.498
- Here's the key.
- Thank you.

00:14:42.298 --> 00:14:45.175
Well, if you want
anything, just ring.

00:14:57.981 --> 00:15:00.315
Honey. Come on.

00:15:07.907 --> 00:15:10.492
Got to carry you
over the threshold.

00:15:33.516 --> 00:15:35.100
Window shopper.

00:16:25.234 --> 00:16:27.110
How's your leg?

00:16:27.195 --> 00:16:28.570
It hurts a little.

00:16:29.197 --> 00:16:30.656
And your stomach?

00:16:30.740 --> 00:16:32.240
Empty as a football.

00:16:34.911 --> 00:16:36.828
And your love life?

00:16:36.913 --> 00:16:38.538
Not too active.

00:16:40.124 --> 00:16:42.250
Anything else bothering you?

00:16:42.585 --> 00:16:43.877
Mmm-hmm.

00:16:44.504 --> 00:16:46.129
Who are you?

00:16:48.591 --> 00:16:52.636
Reading from top to bottom, Lisa

00:16:56.140 --> 00:16:57.474
Carol

00:17:01.813 --> 00:17:03.105
Fremont.

00:17:04.691 --> 00:17:08.151
Is this the Lisa Fremont who never
wears the same dress twice?

00:17:08.236 --> 00:17:10.696
Only because it's
expected of her.

00:17:10.780 --> 00:17:14.533
It's right off the Paris plane.
Do you think it'll sell?

00:17:14.617 --> 00:17:17.202
That depends on the quote,
you know. Let's see now.

00:17:17.286 --> 00:17:22.040
There's the airplane ticket over and import
duties, hidden taxes, profit markup...

00:17:22.125 --> 00:17:24.084
A steal at $1100.

00:17:24.168 --> 00:17:26.503
1100?

00:17:26.587 --> 00:17:29.047
They ought to list that dress
on the stock exchange.

00:17:29.132 --> 00:17:32.175
Why, we sell a dozen a
day in this price range.

00:17:32.260 --> 00:17:33.719
Who buys them, tax collectors?

00:17:33.803 --> 00:17:37.264
Even if I had to pay, it would be worth it.
Just for the occasion.

00:17:37.348 --> 00:17:39.474
Why, is something big
going on somewhere?

00:17:39.559 --> 00:17:42.352
It's going on right here. It's a big night.

00:17:42.437 --> 00:17:47.774
It's just an old run-on-the-mill Wednesday.
The calendar's full of them.

00:17:47.859 --> 00:17:52.904
It's opening night of the last depressing
week of L.B. Jefferies in a cast.

00:17:52.989 --> 00:17:56.575
Well, I haven't noticed a big
demand for tickets or anything.

00:17:56.659 --> 00:17:59.453
That's because I
bought out the house.

00:17:59.537 --> 00:18:02.330
You know, this cigarette
box has seen better days.

00:18:02.415 --> 00:18:06.960
I picked that up in Shanghai,
which has also seen better days.

00:18:07.044 --> 00:18:11.339
It's cracked and you never use it.
It's too ornate.

00:18:11.424 --> 00:18:15.302
I'm sending up a plain, flat, silver
one with just your initials engraved.

00:18:15.386 --> 00:18:18.054
That's no way to spend
your hard-earned money.

00:18:18.139 --> 00:18:19.556
Well, I wanted to.

00:18:20.349 --> 00:18:21.391
Oh!

00:18:23.311 --> 00:18:26.396
What would you think of
starting off with dinner at 21?

00:18:26.481 --> 00:18:29.024
You have, perhaps, an
ambulance downstairs?

00:18:29.108 --> 00:18:32.694
No, better than that. 21.

00:18:37.116 --> 00:18:40.702
Thank you for waiting, Carl. The
kitchen's right there on the left.

00:18:40.787 --> 00:18:42.537
Oh, I'll take the wine.

00:18:45.249 --> 00:18:47.042
- Good evening, Mr. Jefferies.
- Carl.

00:18:47.126 --> 00:18:49.753
Just put everything in
the oven, Carl, on low.

00:18:49.879 --> 00:18:51.463
- Yes, madam.
- Let's open the wine now.

00:18:51.547 --> 00:18:52.923
All right.

00:18:53.716 --> 00:18:55.133
It's a Montrachet.

00:18:55.218 --> 00:18:58.386
A great big glassful. There's
a corkscrew right over there.

00:19:00.139 --> 00:19:01.848
Here, I'll do it.

00:19:03.601 --> 00:19:04.601
Big enough?

00:19:04.685 --> 00:19:06.144
Yeah, they're fine.

00:19:06.229 --> 00:19:10.065
I can't think of anything more boring or
tiresome than what you've been through,

00:19:10.191 --> 00:19:11.942
- and the last week must be the hardest.
- Let me, sir.

00:19:12.026 --> 00:19:13.610
All right.

00:19:13.694 --> 00:19:16.780
Yeah, I want to get this
thing off and get moving.

00:19:16.864 --> 00:19:20.408
Well, I'm going to make this
a week you'll never forget.

00:19:22.912 --> 00:19:24.913
Fine, thanks.

00:19:24.997 --> 00:19:27.290
Just a minute, Carl.

00:19:27.375 --> 00:19:29.334
This will take care
of the taxi as well.

00:19:29.418 --> 00:19:30.627
Thank you, Miss Fremont.

00:19:30.711 --> 00:19:32.212
Have a pleasant dinner, Mr.
Jefferies.

00:19:32.296 --> 00:19:34.589
All right. Good night.

00:19:34.674 --> 00:19:36.091
Good night.

00:19:37.885 --> 00:19:39.845
What a day I've had.

00:19:39.929 --> 00:19:40.929
Are you tired?

00:19:40.972 --> 00:19:42.055
Not a bit.

00:19:42.139 --> 00:19:44.307
I was all morning
in a sales meeting,

00:19:44.392 --> 00:19:47.894
then I had to dash to the Waldorf for
a quick drink with Madame Dufresne,

00:19:47.979 --> 00:19:51.147
who's just over from Paris
with some spy reports.

00:19:52.316 --> 00:19:56.278
And then I had to go to '21 ' and have
lunch with the Harper's Bazaar people.

00:19:56.404 --> 00:19:58.363
And that's when
I ordered dinner.

00:19:58.447 --> 00:20:01.199
Then I had two fall
showings 20 blocks apart.

00:20:01.284 --> 00:20:03.869
Then I had to have a cocktail
with Leland and Slim Hayward.

00:20:03.953 --> 00:20:05.662
We're trying to
get his new show.

00:20:05.746 --> 00:20:07.789
And then I had to
dash back and change.

00:20:07.874 --> 00:20:12.419
Well, now, tell me. Tell me. Now,
what was Mrs. Hayward wearing?

00:20:12.545 --> 00:20:14.379
- Oh, she looked wonderfully cool.
- She did.

00:20:14.463 --> 00:20:17.340
She had on the most
divine Italian hand-print

00:20:17.466 --> 00:20:19.426
- mousseline de soie...
- Oh, Italian?

00:20:19.552 --> 00:20:21.553
- Oh, you.
- Italian. Imagine.

00:20:21.637 --> 00:20:25.098
To think I planted three nice items
in the columns about you today.

00:20:25.182 --> 00:20:26.182
You did?

00:20:26.267 --> 00:20:27.726
You can't buy that
kind of publicity.

00:20:27.810 --> 00:20:29.394
I know.

00:20:29.478 --> 00:20:33.356
Someday you may want to open
up a studio of your own here.

00:20:33.441 --> 00:20:37.110
How would I run it
from, say, Pakistan?

00:20:37.820 --> 00:20:39.446
Jeff...

00:20:40.489 --> 00:20:44.743
Isn't it time you came home? You
could pick your assignment.

00:20:45.828 --> 00:20:47.662
I wish there was one I wanted.

00:20:47.747 --> 00:20:48.997
Make the one you want.

00:20:49.123 --> 00:20:50.916
- You mean leave the magazine?
- Yes.

00:20:51.000 --> 00:20:52.000
For what?

00:20:52.043 --> 00:20:53.919
For yourself and me.

00:20:55.504 --> 00:20:57.297
I could get you a dozen
assignments tomorrow.

00:20:59.467 --> 00:21:01.343
Don't laugh. I could do it.

00:21:01.427 --> 00:21:03.219
That's what I'm afraid of.

00:21:03.304 --> 00:21:06.556
Can you see me driving down to
the fashion salon in a jeep,

00:21:06.641 --> 00:21:09.768
wearing combat boots
and a three-day beard?

00:21:09.852 --> 00:21:11.227
Wouldn't that make a hit?

00:21:11.354 --> 00:21:15.982
I could see you looking very handsome and
successful in a dark blue flannel suit.

00:21:16.067 --> 00:21:19.653
Let's stop talking
nonsense, shall we?

00:21:19.737 --> 00:21:20.820
Hmm?

00:21:23.449 --> 00:21:26.451
Guess I'd better start
setting up for dinner.

00:23:30.826 --> 00:23:32.494
Miss Lonelyheart.

00:23:32.578 --> 00:23:35.413
At least that's something you'll
never have to worry about.

00:23:35.498 --> 00:23:37.082
Oh?

00:23:37.166 --> 00:23:41.044
You can see my apartment from here,
all the way up on 63rd Street?

00:23:41.128 --> 00:23:44.297
No, not exactly, but we have
a little apartment here

00:23:44.381 --> 00:23:46.591
that's probably about
as popular as yours.

00:23:46.675 --> 00:23:50.261
You remember, of course, Miss
Torso, the ballet dancer?

00:23:51.305 --> 00:23:54.557
She's like a queen bee with
her pick of the drones.

00:24:04.235 --> 00:24:07.987
I'd say she's doing a woman's hardest job.
Juggling wolves.

00:24:15.037 --> 00:24:16.371
Thank you.

00:24:28.467 --> 00:24:31.302
Well, she picked the most
prosperous-looking one.

00:24:31.387 --> 00:24:34.472
She's not in love with
him or any of them.

00:24:34.557 --> 00:24:37.142
Oh, how can you
tell that from here?

00:24:38.227 --> 00:24:41.437
You said it resembled
my apartment, didn't you?

00:24:57.746 --> 00:25:00.081
I hope they're cooked this time.

00:26:25.542 --> 00:26:27.919
Where's that wonderful
music coming from?

00:26:28.003 --> 00:26:31.256
Some songwriter over there
in the studio apartment.

00:26:31.340 --> 00:26:32.715
Wow!

00:26:32.800 --> 00:26:36.844
He lives alone. Probably
had a very unhappy marriage.

00:26:38.555 --> 00:26:40.348
Oh, it's enchanting.

00:26:43.644 --> 00:26:47.272
It's almost as if it were being
written especially for us.

00:26:47.356 --> 00:26:48.398
Hmm.

00:26:48.482 --> 00:26:51.484
No wonder he's having so
much trouble with it.

00:26:54.196 --> 00:26:56.823
At least you can't say
the dinner isn't right.

00:26:56.907 --> 00:27:00.034
Lisa, it's perfect.

00:27:02.121 --> 00:27:03.538
As always.

00:27:14.758 --> 00:27:17.802
There can't be that much difference
between people and the way they live.

00:27:17.886 --> 00:27:20.346
We all eat, talk, drink,
laugh, wear clothes.

00:27:20.431 --> 00:27:21.889
Well, now look...

00:27:21.974 --> 00:27:24.809
If you're saying all this because you
don't want to tell me the truth,

00:27:24.893 --> 00:27:27.228
because you're hiding something from
me, then maybe I can understand.

00:27:27.313 --> 00:27:28.980
I'm not hiding anything.
It's just that...

00:27:29.064 --> 00:27:30.440
It doesn't make sense.

00:27:30.524 --> 00:27:33.651
What's so different about it here
from over there or anyplace you go

00:27:33.736 --> 00:27:36.321
that one person couldn't live
in both places just as easily?

00:27:36.405 --> 00:27:37.989
Some people can. Now, if
you'll just let me...

00:27:38.073 --> 00:27:41.409
What is it but traveling from one
place to another, taking pictures?

00:27:41.493 --> 00:27:43.661
It's just like being a tourist
on an endless vacation.

00:27:43.746 --> 00:27:45.079
Okay. Now
that's your opinion.

00:27:45.164 --> 00:27:46.998
You're entitled to it. Now,
let me give you my side.

00:27:47.082 --> 00:27:49.125
It's ridiculous to say
that it can only be done

00:27:49.209 --> 00:27:52.253
by a special, private little
group of anointed people.

00:27:52.338 --> 00:27:55.298
I made a simple statement,
a true statement,

00:27:55.382 --> 00:27:58.885
but I can back it up if you'd
just shut up for a minute.

00:27:58.969 --> 00:28:02.305
If your opinion is as rude as your
manner, I don't think I care to hear it.

00:28:02.389 --> 00:28:03.806
Oh, come on now.
Simmer down.

00:28:03.891 --> 00:28:07.185
I can't fit in here.
You can't fit in there.

00:28:07.269 --> 00:28:10.521
I mean, according to you, people should
be born, live and die on the same spot!

00:28:10.606 --> 00:28:11.814
Shut up!

00:28:14.568 --> 00:28:16.944
Did you ever eat
fish heads and rice?

00:28:17.029 --> 00:28:18.654
Of course not.

00:28:18.739 --> 00:28:21.282
Well, you might have
to if you went with me.

00:28:21.367 --> 00:28:27.121
Did you ever try to keep warm in a C-54
at 15,000 feet, 20 degrees below zero?

00:28:27.206 --> 00:28:30.375
Oh, I do it all the time. Whenever
I have a few minutes after lunch.

00:28:30.459 --> 00:28:32.919
Did you ever get shot at?
Did you ever get run over?

00:28:33.003 --> 00:28:34.420
Did you ever get
sandbagged at night

00:28:34.505 --> 00:28:37.799
because somebody got unfavorable
publicity from your camera?

00:28:37.883 --> 00:28:40.676
Did you ever... Those high heels,
they'll be great in the jungle.

00:28:40.761 --> 00:28:42.929
And the nylons and
those six-ounce lingerie.

00:28:43.013 --> 00:28:44.555
- Three.
- All right, three.

00:28:44.640 --> 00:28:48.059
They'll make a big hit in Finland,
just before you freeze to death.

00:28:48.143 --> 00:28:51.729
Well, if there's one thing I know,
it's how to wear the proper clothes.

00:28:51.814 --> 00:28:52.980
Yeah, yeah.

00:28:53.065 --> 00:28:56.609
Well, try and find a raincoat in
Brazil, even when it isn't raining.

00:28:56.693 --> 00:29:00.321
Lisa, in this job
you carry one suitcase.

00:29:00.406 --> 00:29:02.907
Your home is the available
transportation.

00:29:02.991 --> 00:29:05.159
You don't sleep very
much. You bathe less.

00:29:05.244 --> 00:29:07.286
And sometimes the
food that you eat

00:29:07.371 --> 00:29:11.124
is made from things that you couldn't
even look at when they're alive.

00:29:11.208 --> 00:29:15.002
Jeff, you don't have to be deliberately
repulsive just to impress me I'm wrong.

00:29:15.087 --> 00:29:18.423
Deliberately repulsive? I'm just
trying to make it sound good.

00:29:18.507 --> 00:29:21.759
You just have to face it, Lisa, you're
not meant for that kind of a life.

00:29:21.844 --> 00:29:23.553
Few people are.

00:29:25.389 --> 00:29:26.889
You're too stubborn
to argue with.

00:29:26.974 --> 00:29:30.435
I'm not stubborn.
I'm just truthful.

00:29:30.519 --> 00:29:34.397
I know, a lesser man would have
told me it was one long holiday,

00:29:34.481 --> 00:29:38.192
and I would have been awakened
to a rude disillusionment.

00:29:38.277 --> 00:29:40.570
Oh, well now, wait a minute.
Wait a minute.

00:29:40.654 --> 00:29:45.491
If you want to get vicious on this thing,
I'd be very happy to accommodate you.

00:29:46.869 --> 00:29:49.745
No, I don't
particularly want that.

00:29:52.124 --> 00:29:53.624
So that's it?

00:29:53.709 --> 00:29:56.836
You won't stay here,
and I can't go with you.

00:29:56.920 --> 00:29:59.046
It would be the wrong thing.

00:30:01.216 --> 00:30:05.219
You don't think either one
of us could ever change?

00:30:05.304 --> 00:30:07.513
Right now it doesn't seem so.

00:30:12.603 --> 00:30:16.397
I'm in love with you. I don't
care what you do for a living.

00:30:17.733 --> 00:30:20.359
I'd just like to be
part of it somehow.

00:30:22.613 --> 00:30:25.573
It's deflating to find out the
only way I can be part of it

00:30:25.657 --> 00:30:28.784
is to take out a subscription
to your magazine.

00:30:30.329 --> 00:30:33.122
I guess I'm not the
girl I thought I was.

00:30:33.749 --> 00:30:35.208
There's nothing wrong
with you, Lisa.

00:30:35.292 --> 00:30:38.294
You've got this town in
the palm of your hand.

00:30:40.172 --> 00:30:41.923
Not quite, it seems.

00:30:44.092 --> 00:30:45.718
Goodbye, Jeff.

00:30:45.802 --> 00:30:47.011
You mean good night.

00:30:47.095 --> 00:30:48.471
I mean what I said.

00:30:48.555 --> 00:30:51.933
Well, Lisa, couldn't we just...

00:30:52.226 --> 00:30:53.601
Uh...

00:30:53.977 --> 00:30:58.064
Couldn't we just keep
things status quo?

00:31:00.901 --> 00:31:02.527
Without any future?

00:31:02.611 --> 00:31:04.987
When am I gonna see you again?

00:31:06.615 --> 00:31:08.533
Not for a long time.

00:31:10.452 --> 00:31:11.744
At least

00:31:11.828 --> 00:31:13.871
not until tomorrow night.

00:31:50.325 --> 00:31:52.118
Don't!

00:32:17.144 --> 00:32:18.519
Hey! Rain.

00:32:22.357 --> 00:32:25.985
Grab that. The rest of the blanket.
Wait, I'll get the clock.

00:32:26.069 --> 00:32:27.403
Oh, no!

00:32:30.365 --> 00:32:31.616
Put it in, now.

00:32:35.370 --> 00:32:36.912
Pull on it.

00:32:36.997 --> 00:32:38.956
Let me do it.

00:32:39.041 --> 00:32:40.708
In you go.

00:34:57.179 --> 00:35:00.681
No, you can't come in.
It's much too late.

00:35:00.766 --> 00:35:05.102
No, no, not now. Get your foot out
of the way. No, I said good night.

00:36:46.079 --> 00:36:47.788
What's that supposed
to be, ma'am?

00:36:47.873 --> 00:36:49.874
It's called "Hunger".

00:37:13.315 --> 00:37:16.191
You'd think the rain would
have cooled things off.

00:37:16.276 --> 00:37:17.443
All it did was
make the heat wet.

00:37:17.527 --> 00:37:18.569
That's it.
That's it.

00:37:18.653 --> 00:37:20.654
That's stiff one, right there.
Right there.

00:37:20.739 --> 00:37:23.157
You know, the insurance
company would be much happier

00:37:23.241 --> 00:37:26.285
if you'd sleep in bed at night
instead of in that wheelchair.

00:37:26.369 --> 00:37:27.453
How'd you know?

00:37:27.537 --> 00:37:29.204
Eyes are all bloodshot.

00:37:29.289 --> 00:37:31.249
Must have been watching out
that window for hours.

00:37:31.333 --> 00:37:32.791
Yeah, I was.

00:37:32.876 --> 00:37:34.460
What are you gonna do if
one of them catches you?

00:37:34.544 --> 00:37:36.086
It depends which one.

00:37:36.171 --> 00:37:37.671
Miss Torso, for example...

00:37:37.756 --> 00:37:39.924
You keep your mind off her.

00:37:40.008 --> 00:37:42.468
She sure is the "Eat,
drink and be merry" girl.

00:37:42.552 --> 00:37:45.721
Yeah, she'll wind up fat,
alcoholic and miserable.

00:37:45.805 --> 00:37:47.097
Yeah.

00:37:47.182 --> 00:37:53.312
Speaking of misery, poor Miss Lonelyheart.
She drank herself to sleep again, alone.

00:37:53.396 --> 00:37:55.606
Poor soul.
Oh, well.

00:37:55.690 --> 00:37:57.691
Maybe one day she'll
find her happiness.

00:37:57.776 --> 00:38:00.611
Yeah, and some man
will lose his.

00:38:00.695 --> 00:38:04.281
Isn't there anybody in the neighborhood
who could cast an eye in her direction?

00:38:04.366 --> 00:38:05.741
I don't know.

00:38:05.825 --> 00:38:09.536
It just might be that the
salesman will be available soon.

00:38:09.746 --> 00:38:11.497
Oh, him and his wife
splitting up?

00:38:11.581 --> 00:38:13.290
I just can't figure it.

00:38:13.375 --> 00:38:18.045
He went out several times last night
in the rain, carrying his sample case.

00:38:18.129 --> 00:38:19.409
Well, he's a salesman, isn't he?

00:38:19.422 --> 00:38:21.799
What would he be selling
at 3:00 in the morning?

00:38:21.883 --> 00:38:23.300
Flashlights.

00:38:23.385 --> 00:38:27.554
Luminous dials for watches.
House numbers that light up.

00:38:27.639 --> 00:38:30.849
I don't think so.
I don't think so.

00:38:31.685 --> 00:38:33.978
I think he was taking something
out of the apartment.

00:38:34.062 --> 00:38:35.062
Uh-huh.

00:38:36.356 --> 00:38:38.148
His personal effects.

00:38:39.067 --> 00:38:41.610
He's gonna run out
on her, the coward.

00:38:41.695 --> 00:38:43.153
Yeah.

00:38:43.238 --> 00:38:45.906
Sometimes it's worse
to stay than it is to run.

00:38:45.991 --> 00:38:50.828
Yeah, well, it takes a particularly low
type of man to do a thing like that.

00:38:52.455 --> 00:38:55.624
How about this morning?
Any further developments?

00:38:56.668 --> 00:38:58.752
The shades are all
drawn in the apartment.

00:38:58.878 --> 00:39:00.879
- In this heat?
- Yeah.

00:39:00.964 --> 00:39:02.798
Well, they're up now.

00:39:08.596 --> 00:39:10.014
Get back!
Get back!

00:39:10.098 --> 00:39:11.348
Where do you want me to go?

00:39:11.433 --> 00:39:12.725
Come on, get out of sight.
Get out of sight.

00:39:12.809 --> 00:39:14.226
What is it?
What's the matter?

00:39:14.310 --> 00:39:17.021
That salesman's looking out
of his window. You see?

00:39:17.105 --> 00:39:19.064
Get back!
He'll see you.

00:39:19.149 --> 00:39:21.608
I'm not shy. I've been
looked at before.

00:39:21.693 --> 00:39:23.652
That's no ordinary look.

00:39:25.280 --> 00:39:27.031
That's the kind
of look a man gives

00:39:27.115 --> 00:39:30.284
when he's afraid somebody
might be watching him.

00:39:46.968 --> 00:39:49.428
Get away from there. Get away from there.
He'll be after you.

00:39:49.512 --> 00:39:51.722
Go on, into the house.
Into the house.

00:39:54.517 --> 00:39:57.311
Goodbye, Mr. Jefferies.
See you tomorrow.

00:39:57.395 --> 00:39:58.645
Uh-huh.

00:40:07.155 --> 00:40:09.364
And don't sleep in
that chair again.

00:40:09.449 --> 00:40:10.449
Uh-huh.

00:40:10.492 --> 00:40:11.700
"Uh-huh.
Uh-huh."

00:40:11.951 --> 00:40:13.952
Great conversationalist.

00:40:16.372 --> 00:40:17.664
Stella.

00:40:18.792 --> 00:40:22.628
Take those binoculars out of the
case and bring them here, will you?

00:40:22.712 --> 00:40:25.547
Trouble.
I can smell it.

00:40:26.925 --> 00:40:29.676
I'll be glad when they crack that
cast, and I can get out of here.

00:40:29.761 --> 00:40:30.928
Uh-huh.

00:44:07.270 --> 00:44:10.522
How far does a girl have to
go before you'll notice her?

00:44:10.606 --> 00:44:14.651
Well, if she's pretty enough, she
doesn't have to go anywhere.

00:44:14.736 --> 00:44:16.945
She just has to "be."

00:44:17.030 --> 00:44:18.071
Well, ain't I?

00:44:18.823 --> 00:44:20.657
Pay attention to me.

00:44:23.202 --> 00:44:26.788
I'm not exactly on the
other side of the room.

00:44:27.248 --> 00:44:28.832
Your mind is...

00:44:29.751 --> 00:44:32.586
And when I want a man,
I want all of him.

00:44:36.966 --> 00:44:38.675
Don't you ever
have any problems?

00:44:38.760 --> 00:44:40.385
I have one now.

00:44:41.929 --> 00:44:43.180
So do I.

00:44:44.766 --> 00:44:46.641
Tell me about it.

00:44:48.936 --> 00:44:50.103
Why...

00:44:51.356 --> 00:44:57.027
Why would a man leave his apartment three
times on a rainy night with a suitcase,

00:44:57.111 --> 00:44:59.863
and come back three times?

00:44:59.947 --> 00:45:01.782
He likes the way his
wife welcomes him home.

00:45:01.866 --> 00:45:03.784
No, no. No, no.

00:45:03.868 --> 00:45:06.870
No, no. Not this
salesman's wife.

00:45:06.954 --> 00:45:08.955
And why didn't he
go to work today?

00:45:09.040 --> 00:45:11.375
Homework. It's
more interesting.

00:45:14.045 --> 00:45:17.547
What's interesting
about a butcher knife

00:45:17.632 --> 00:45:20.050
and a small saw

00:45:20.134 --> 00:45:22.552
wrapped in newspaper?
Hmm?

00:45:22.637 --> 00:45:25.222
Nothing, thank heaven.

00:45:25.306 --> 00:45:28.183
Why hasn't he been in his
wife's bedroom all day?

00:45:28.309 --> 00:45:30.435
I wouldn't dare answer that.

00:45:31.813 --> 00:45:37.275
Well, listen. I'll answer it, Lisa.
There's something terribly wrong.

00:45:40.154 --> 00:45:42.447
And I'm afraid it's with me.

00:45:42.532 --> 00:45:43.532
What do you think?

00:45:44.992 --> 00:45:47.494
Something too
frightful to utter.

00:45:49.122 --> 00:45:53.333
He went out a few minutes ago in his
undershirt, hasn't come back yet.

00:46:05.680 --> 00:46:08.682
That'd be a terrible
job to tackle.

00:46:14.647 --> 00:46:17.732
Just how would you start
to cut up a human body?

00:46:20.194 --> 00:46:24.406
Jeff, I'll be honest with you. You're
beginning to scare me a little.

00:46:26.868 --> 00:46:29.188
Jeff, did you hear what I said?
You're beginning to scare...

00:46:29.203 --> 00:46:31.204
Shh! Shh!

00:46:31.289 --> 00:46:32.998
He's coming back!

00:47:00.860 --> 00:47:02.777
Jeff, if you could
only see yourself!

00:47:02.862 --> 00:47:03.862
What's the matter?

00:47:03.946 --> 00:47:06.587
Sitting around looking out of the
window to kill time is one thing,

00:47:06.616 --> 00:47:10.702
but doing it the way you are,
with binoculars and wild opinions

00:47:10.786 --> 00:47:13.413
about every little thing
you see, is diseased!

00:47:13.498 --> 00:47:16.166
What, do you think I
consider it recreation?

00:47:16.250 --> 00:47:18.001
I don't know what
you consider it,

00:47:18.085 --> 00:47:20.170
but if you don't stop it,
I'm getting out of here.

00:47:20.254 --> 00:47:21.338
What's the...

00:47:21.422 --> 00:47:22.797
What is it you're looking for?

00:47:22.882 --> 00:47:25.675
I just want to find out what's the matter
with the salesman's wife, that's all.

00:47:25.760 --> 00:47:27.427
Does that make me
sound like a madman?

00:47:27.512 --> 00:47:29.346
What makes you think there's
something the matter with her?

00:47:29.430 --> 00:47:33.016
A lot of things. She's an invalid.
She demands constant care.

00:47:33.100 --> 00:47:37.354
Yet neither the husband or anybody else
has been in to see her all day. Why?

00:47:39.106 --> 00:47:40.440
Maybe she died.

00:47:40.525 --> 00:47:43.193
Where's the doctor?
Where's the undertaker?

00:47:43.277 --> 00:47:46.154
She could be sleeping,
under sedatives.

00:47:46.239 --> 00:47:49.074
He's in there now.
There's nothing to see.

00:47:49.158 --> 00:47:51.660
There is something... I've
seen it through that window.

00:47:51.744 --> 00:47:54.579
I've seen bickering
and family quarrels

00:47:54.664 --> 00:47:57.916
and mysterious trips at night
and knives and saws and ropes.

00:47:58.000 --> 00:47:59.876
And now, since last evening,
not a sign of the wife.

00:47:59.961 --> 00:48:01.336
All right. Now you
tell me where she is.

00:48:01.462 --> 00:48:03.382
- I don't know.
- What's she doing? Where is she?

00:48:03.464 --> 00:48:06.424
Maybe he's leaving his wife. I don't know.
I don't care!

00:48:06.509 --> 00:48:09.636
Lots of people have knives and saws
and ropes around their houses.

00:48:09.720 --> 00:48:12.681
And lots of men don't speak
to their wives all day.

00:48:12.765 --> 00:48:15.350
Lots of wives nag and men
hate them and trouble starts,

00:48:15.434 --> 00:48:19.563
but very, very few of them end up in
murder, if that's what you're thinking.

00:48:19.647 --> 00:48:22.087
It's pretty hard for you to keep
away from that word, isn't it?

00:48:22.108 --> 00:48:24.776
- You could see all that he did, couldn't you?
- Of course...

00:48:24.860 --> 00:48:26.486
You could see because
the shades were up

00:48:26.571 --> 00:48:29.864
and he walked along the corridor
and the street and the backyard.

00:48:29.949 --> 00:48:31.324
I've seen him in the backyard,
fixing the flowers...

00:48:31.409 --> 00:48:34.411
Oh, Jeff, do you think a murderer
would let you see all that?

00:48:34.495 --> 00:48:37.205
That he wouldn't pull the shades
down and hide behind them?

00:48:37.290 --> 00:48:39.416
Just where he's being clever.
He's being nonchalant about it.

00:48:39.500 --> 00:48:41.334
And that's where you're
not being clever.

00:48:41.419 --> 00:48:45.255
A murderer would never parade his
crime in front of an open window.

00:48:45.339 --> 00:48:46.423
Why not?

00:48:46.507 --> 00:48:47.507
Why, for all you know,

00:48:47.592 --> 00:48:50.760
there's probably something a lot more
sinister going on behind those windows.

00:48:50.845 --> 00:48:52.095
Where?

00:48:52.179 --> 00:48:53.263
Oh!

00:48:55.808 --> 00:48:57.225
No comment.

00:49:19.832 --> 00:49:23.418
Let's start from the
beginning again, Jeff.

00:49:23.502 --> 00:49:26.880
Tell me everything you saw

00:49:26.964 --> 00:49:29.758
and what you think it means.

00:49:42.229 --> 00:49:43.229
Yeah?

00:49:43.314 --> 00:49:44.435
<i>The name on the second floor</i>

00:49:44.482 --> 00:49:47.984
<i>rear mail box reads,
"Mr. And Mrs. Lars."</i>

00:49:48.069 --> 00:49:50.445
<i>That's L-A-R-S.</i>

00:49:50.529 --> 00:49:52.489
<i>Lars Thorwald.</i>

00:49:52.573 --> 00:49:54.240
What's the number of
the apartment house?

00:49:54.325 --> 00:49:56.868
<i>125 West 9th Street.</i>

00:49:58.079 --> 00:49:59.496
Thank you, dear.

00:49:59.580 --> 00:50:01.831
<i>Okay, chief. What's my next assignment?</i>

00:50:01.916 --> 00:50:02.916
Just go home.

00:50:03.834 --> 00:50:06.711
<i>All right, but what's he doing now?</i>

00:50:06.796 --> 00:50:10.256
He's just sitting in the
living room in the dark.

00:50:11.050 --> 00:50:13.593
Hasn't gone near the bedroom.

00:50:13.678 --> 00:50:15.345
Now you go home and get some sleep.

00:50:15.429 --> 00:50:17.389
- Good night.
<i>- Good night.</i>

00:50:27.274 --> 00:50:28.566
<i>All right. What's it all about, Jeff?</i>

00:50:28.651 --> 00:50:31.986
Now look, Doyle, it's just something
I can't tell you over the telephone.

00:50:32.071 --> 00:50:33.947
You have to be here
and see the whole setup.

00:50:34.031 --> 00:50:35.031
<i>Important, huh?</i>

00:50:35.116 --> 00:50:36.616
Well, it's probably
nothing important at all.

00:50:36.701 --> 00:50:38.785
It's just a little neighborhood
murder, that's all.

00:50:38.869 --> 00:50:39.950
<i>Did you say "murder", Jeff?</i>

00:50:39.954 --> 00:50:41.579
Yes, as a matter of fact,
I did say "murder".

00:50:41.664 --> 00:50:43.039
<i>Oh, come now.</i>

00:50:43.124 --> 00:50:46.459
My only thought was throwing a little
business your way, that's all.

00:50:46.544 --> 00:50:49.544
I figured a good detective would jump
at the chance of something to detect.

00:50:49.630 --> 00:50:51.214
<i>- I'm not working.</i>
- What?

00:50:51.298 --> 00:50:52.966
<i>This happens to be my day off.</i>

00:50:53.050 --> 00:50:56.010
Well, I usually took my best
pictures on my day off.

00:50:56.137 --> 00:50:57.178
<i>I'll drop by.</i>

00:50:57.263 --> 00:50:59.889
Okay, Doyle. All right. As soon as you can.

00:51:01.308 --> 00:51:05.103
Bless your heart, Stella.
Gee whiz, look at this.

00:51:05.187 --> 00:51:07.147
I can't tell you what a
welcome sight this is.

00:51:07.231 --> 00:51:09.232
No wonder your husband still loves you.

00:51:09.316 --> 00:51:10.900
- The police.
- What?

00:51:10.985 --> 00:51:11.985
You called the police.

00:51:12.069 --> 00:51:13.987
Well, not exactly.

00:51:14.071 --> 00:51:17.782
Not an official call. It's
just an old friend of mine.

00:51:17.867 --> 00:51:20.910
An old, ornery friend of mine.

00:51:20.995 --> 00:51:23.830
Just where do you suppose he cut her up?

00:51:25.499 --> 00:51:28.001
Of course. The bathtub.

00:51:28.878 --> 00:51:32.922
That's the only place where he
could have washed away the blood.

00:51:41.807 --> 00:51:45.685
He better get that trunk out of
there before it starts to leak.

00:52:07.208 --> 00:52:08.625
Harry?

00:52:14.006 --> 00:52:16.049
Look, look, Mr. Jefferies.

00:52:53.754 --> 00:52:56.035
I thought Doyle would be here
by the time the trunk left,

00:52:56.090 --> 00:52:58.550
or I'd have called the police.
Now we're gonna lose it.

00:52:58.676 --> 00:53:00.218
- Hold everything.
- Don't do anything foolish.

00:53:00.302 --> 00:53:02.136
I'm just gonna get the name
off that freight truck.

00:53:02.221 --> 00:53:04.472
I'll keep an eye on the alley.

00:53:18.028 --> 00:53:19.654
Long distance.

00:53:44.805 --> 00:53:48.391
You didn't see the killing or the body.
How do you know there was a murder?

00:53:48.475 --> 00:53:51.519
Because everything this fellow's
done has been suspicious.

00:53:51.604 --> 00:53:55.356
Trips at night in the rain, and
knives and saws and trunks with rope

00:53:55.441 --> 00:53:57.692
and now this wife that isn't there anymore.

00:53:57.776 --> 00:54:02.572
I admit it all has a mysterious sound.
It could be any number of things.

00:54:02.656 --> 00:54:03.990
Murder's the least plausible.

00:54:04.074 --> 00:54:06.492
Doyle, don't tell me he's
an unemployed magician,

00:54:06.577 --> 00:54:09.579
amusing the neighborhood with his
sleight of hand. Don't tell me that.

00:54:09.663 --> 00:54:12.081
It's too obvious and stupid
a way to commit murder.

00:54:12.166 --> 00:54:13.791
In full view of 50 windows?

00:54:13.876 --> 00:54:15.084
Then sit over there smoking a cigar,

00:54:15.169 --> 00:54:16.753
waiting for the police
to come and pick him up?

00:54:16.837 --> 00:54:19.255
All right, Officer, do your duty.
Go over and pick him up.

00:54:19.340 --> 00:54:22.592
Jeff, you've got a lot
to learn about homicide.

00:54:22.676 --> 00:54:24.886
Why, morons have committed
murder so shrewdly,

00:54:24.970 --> 00:54:28.222
it's taken a hundred trained
police minds to catch them.

00:54:28.307 --> 00:54:30.934
That salesman wouldn't just
knock his wife off after dinner

00:54:31.018 --> 00:54:33.519
and toss her in the trunk
and put her in storage.

00:54:33.604 --> 00:54:34.938
I'll bet it's been done.

00:54:35.022 --> 00:54:38.232
Most everything's been done, under panic.

00:54:38.317 --> 00:54:40.401
This is a thousand-to-one shot.

00:54:40.486 --> 00:54:43.780
He's still sitting around the apartment.
That man's not panicked.

00:54:43.864 --> 00:54:45.949
You think I made all this up?

00:54:46.033 --> 00:54:47.951
Well, I think you saw something.

00:54:48.035 --> 00:54:50.662
There's probably a very
simple explanation for that.

00:54:50.746 --> 00:54:52.288
For instance?

00:54:52.373 --> 00:54:53.915
Wife took a trip.

00:54:53.999 --> 00:54:56.000
His wife was sick in bed.

00:54:57.461 --> 00:54:59.253
Yeah, so you told me.

00:55:00.839 --> 00:55:03.299
Well, Jeff, I've got to run along.

00:55:04.551 --> 00:55:09.806
I won't report this to the department.
Let me poke into it a little on my own.

00:55:09.890 --> 00:55:12.642
No sense in your getting a
lot of ridiculous publicity.

00:55:12.726 --> 00:55:14.060
Thank you.

00:55:16.271 --> 00:55:19.232
We know the wife is gone, so I'll
see if I can find out where.

00:55:19.316 --> 00:55:20.566
Do that.

00:55:21.777 --> 00:55:24.278
You had any headaches lately?

00:55:24.363 --> 00:55:25.738
Not until you showed up.

00:55:26.782 --> 00:55:29.784
It'll wear off, along
with the hallucinations.

00:55:29.868 --> 00:55:31.452
See you around.

00:55:55.853 --> 00:55:57.311
Get along.

00:56:18.584 --> 00:56:20.084
He has a six months' lease.

00:56:20.169 --> 00:56:23.129
Used up a little more than
five and a half months of it.

00:56:23.213 --> 00:56:25.631
He's quiet, drinks, but not to drunkenness.

00:56:25.716 --> 00:56:28.634
Pays his bills promptly with money
earned as a costume jewelry salesman.

00:56:28.719 --> 00:56:30.053
Wholesale.

00:56:30.304 --> 00:56:33.431
Kept to himself. None of his neighbors
got close to him or his wife.

00:56:33.515 --> 00:56:35.349
Yeah, well, I think they
missed their chance with her.

00:56:35.434 --> 00:56:36.434
She never left the apartment...

00:56:36.477 --> 00:56:38.269
- Where is she? The icebox?
- ...until yesterday morning.

00:56:38.395 --> 00:56:40.730
- What time?
- 6:00 a.m.

00:56:40.814 --> 00:56:42.148
6:00 a.m.

00:56:43.192 --> 00:56:45.985
I think that's about the
time I fell asleep.

00:56:46.070 --> 00:56:47.320
Too bad.

00:56:47.654 --> 00:56:51.491
Thorwalds were leaving their
apartment at just that time.

00:56:52.534 --> 00:56:54.535
Feel a little foolish?

00:56:54.953 --> 00:56:56.496
No, not yet.

00:57:08.133 --> 00:57:09.926
How's your wife?

00:57:10.010 --> 00:57:11.177
Oh, she's fine.

00:57:14.848 --> 00:57:16.891
Who said they left then?

00:57:17.518 --> 00:57:18.518
Who left where?

00:57:18.602 --> 00:57:20.686
The Thorwalds, at 6:00 in the morning.

00:57:20.771 --> 00:57:23.439
Oh, the building superintendent
and two tenants.

00:57:23.524 --> 00:57:26.567
Flat statements, no hesitation.
They jived with the letter.

00:57:26.652 --> 00:57:29.070
Thorwalds were on their way
to the railroad station.

00:57:29.154 --> 00:57:32.698
Well, now, Tom, how could
anybody possibly guess that?

00:57:32.783 --> 00:57:36.911
What, did they have signs on their
luggage, saying, "Grand Central or bust"?

00:57:36.995 --> 00:57:39.747
The superintendent met
Thorwald on his way back.

00:57:39.832 --> 00:57:42.959
Thorwald told him that he'd put his
wife on a train to the country.

00:57:43.043 --> 00:57:46.212
I see. I'd say this is a pretty
convenient guy, this superintendent.

00:57:46.296 --> 00:57:49.215
Have you checked his
bank statements lately?

00:57:50.384 --> 00:57:51.467
Huh?

00:57:51.552 --> 00:57:54.095
Well, what good's his information?

00:57:54.179 --> 00:57:56.556
It's a secondhand version
of an unsupported story

00:57:56.640 --> 00:57:58.391
by the murderer himself, Thorwald.

00:57:58.475 --> 00:58:02.019
Now did anybody actually see
the wife get on the train?

00:58:03.021 --> 00:58:04.021
I hate to remind you,

00:58:04.064 --> 00:58:06.858
but this all started because
you said she was murdered.

00:58:06.942 --> 00:58:10.069
Now, did anyone, including you,
actually see her murdered?

00:58:10.154 --> 00:58:11.988
What are you doing?

00:58:12.072 --> 00:58:16.117
Are you interested in solving this
case or in making me look foolish?

00:58:16.201 --> 00:58:18.327
Well, if possible, both.

00:58:18.412 --> 00:58:19.912
Well, then, do a good job of it.

00:58:19.997 --> 00:58:21.873
Go over there and search
Thorwald's apartment.

00:58:21.957 --> 00:58:23.833
It must be knee-deep in evidence.

00:58:23.917 --> 00:58:25.376
I can't do that.

00:58:25.460 --> 00:58:27.712
Well, no, I don't mean right now,
but when he goes out for a drink,

00:58:27.796 --> 00:58:30.047
or a paper, or something. What
he doesn't know won't hurt him.

00:58:30.132 --> 00:58:32.508
I can't do that, even if he isn't there.

00:58:32.593 --> 00:58:37.346
What's he... Does he have a courtesy card
from the police department, or something?

00:58:37.431 --> 00:58:39.265
Now don't get me mad.

00:58:39.474 --> 00:58:42.602
Not even a detective can walk
into an apartment and search it.

00:58:42.686 --> 00:58:45.771
If I were caught in there, they'd
have my badge within 10 minutes.

00:58:45.856 --> 00:58:48.357
All right. Make sure you don't
get caught, that's all.

00:58:48.442 --> 00:58:50.693
What? If you find something,
you've got a murderer,

00:58:50.777 --> 00:58:52.862
and they don't care anything
about a couple of house rules.

00:58:52.946 --> 00:58:55.031
If you don't find anything,
the fellow's clear.

00:58:55.115 --> 00:58:59.535
At the risk of sounding stuffy, I'd
like to remind you of the Constitution

00:58:59.620 --> 00:59:02.496
and the phrase, "Search
warrant issued by a judge"

00:59:02.581 --> 00:59:04.624
"who knows his Bill of Rights verbatim."

00:59:04.708 --> 00:59:06.292
He must ask for evidence.

00:59:06.376 --> 00:59:07.710
Give him evidence.

00:59:09.588 --> 00:59:11.505
Yeah, I can hear myself.

00:59:11.590 --> 00:59:15.635
"Your Honor, I have a friend
who's an amateur sleuth."

00:59:16.637 --> 00:59:20.389
"Well, the other night after
having a heavy dinner, he..."

00:59:20.474 --> 00:59:22.934
He'd throw the New York State
penal code right in my face.

00:59:23.018 --> 00:59:25.061
And there's six volumes.

00:59:25.812 --> 00:59:28.522
You know, by tomorrow morning there
may not be any evidence left

00:59:28.607 --> 00:59:30.733
over in that apartment. You know that.

00:59:30.817 --> 00:59:33.110
It's a detective's nightmare.

00:59:33.528 --> 00:59:35.905
What do you need before you can search?

00:59:35.989 --> 00:59:37.229
Tell me. Now, what do you need?

00:59:37.282 --> 00:59:39.784
Bloody footsteps leading up to the door?

00:59:39.868 --> 00:59:43.537
One thing I don't need is heckling.
You called me and asked for help.

00:59:43.622 --> 00:59:46.165
Now you're behaving like a taxpayer.

00:59:47.000 --> 00:59:48.918
How did we ever stand
each other in that plane

00:59:49.002 --> 00:59:51.003
for three years during the war?

00:59:53.340 --> 00:59:56.340
I guess I'll go over to the railroad
station and check on Thorwald's story.

00:59:56.385 --> 00:59:58.094
Oh, forget about the story.

00:59:58.178 --> 01:00:00.846
Find the trunk. Mrs. Thorwald's in it.

01:00:01.223 --> 01:00:02.431
Oh, I almost forgot.

01:00:02.516 --> 01:00:05.893
There was a postcard in
Thorwald's mailbox. It was

01:00:06.270 --> 01:00:09.146
mailed 3:30 yesterday
afternoon from Merritsville.

01:00:09.231 --> 01:00:11.315
That's 80 miles north of here.

01:00:11.400 --> 01:00:15.194
Message went, "Arrived okay.
Already feeling better."

01:00:15.279 --> 01:00:16.737
"Love, Anna."

01:00:19.491 --> 01:00:20.574
Oh...

01:00:20.659 --> 01:00:22.034
Is that...

01:00:22.995 --> 01:00:25.496
Anna... Is that who I think it is?

01:00:26.707 --> 01:00:28.207
Mrs. Thorwald.

01:00:31.670 --> 01:00:34.005
Oh, so anything you need, Jeff?

01:00:34.381 --> 01:00:36.924
You might send me a good detective.

01:04:24.319 --> 01:04:25.986
<i>- Hello?</i>
- Hello, Miss Doyle?

01:04:26.071 --> 01:04:27.071
<i>Yes?</i>

01:04:27.113 --> 01:04:28.697
This is Jeff again.
Has Tom come in yet?

01:04:28.782 --> 01:04:29.782
<i>Not yet, Jeff.</i>

01:04:29.824 --> 01:04:31.825
You mean you haven't
even heard from him?

01:04:31.910 --> 01:04:35.412
<i>Not a word. Is it something
really important, Jeff?</i>

01:04:35.497 --> 01:04:37.164
Yeah, I'm afraid it is, Tess.

01:04:37.249 --> 01:04:39.250
<i>I'll have him call the
moment I hear from him.</i>

01:04:39.334 --> 01:04:40.709
No, no, don't bother to do that.

01:04:40.794 --> 01:04:43.379
Just have him get over
here as soon as he can.

01:04:43.463 --> 01:04:45.172
Looks like Thorwald's pulling out tonight.

01:04:45.257 --> 01:04:46.257
<i>Who's Thorwald?</i>

01:04:46.299 --> 01:04:47.424
He'll know, he'll know.

01:04:47.509 --> 01:04:50.219
And Thorwald's a man, Tess, don't worry.

01:04:50.303 --> 01:04:52.680
<i>- Good night, you idiot.</i>
- Good night.

01:05:09.447 --> 01:05:11.282
Long distance again.

01:05:46.860 --> 01:05:49.153
There's somebody at the door.

01:05:53.366 --> 01:05:55.534
- Hi.
- Hello.

01:06:17.724 --> 01:06:19.058
Hello.

01:06:22.395 --> 01:06:23.687
What'd you do to your hair?

01:06:23.730 --> 01:06:25.481
- Oh, well, I just sort of...
- Take a look at Thorwald.

01:06:25.565 --> 01:06:29.026
He's getting ready to pull out for good.
Look at him.

01:06:32.238 --> 01:06:33.989
He doesn't seem to be in any hurry.

01:06:34.074 --> 01:06:36.575
He's been laying out all his
things on one of the beds.

01:06:36.660 --> 01:06:38.911
Shirts, suits, coats, socks.

01:06:38.995 --> 01:06:41.121
Even his wife's... That alligator handbag

01:06:41.247 --> 01:06:43.540
- his wife had on the bedpost.
- What about it?

01:06:43.625 --> 01:06:46.377
He had it hidden in the dresser.
At least, it was there.

01:06:46.461 --> 01:06:50.381
He took it out, went to the telephone
and made a long-distance call.

01:06:50.465 --> 01:06:53.175
He had his wife's jewelry in the handbag.

01:06:53.259 --> 01:06:54.301
Seemed worried about it.

01:06:54.386 --> 01:06:56.178
Asked somebody's advice over the telephone.

01:06:56.262 --> 01:06:57.888
Someone not his wife.

01:06:57.972 --> 01:07:00.140
Well, I never saw him ask her for advice.

01:07:00.225 --> 01:07:04.061
She volunteered plenty, but I
never saw him ask her for any.

01:07:14.447 --> 01:07:15.823
I wonder where he's going.

01:07:15.907 --> 01:07:17.241
I don't know.

01:07:18.076 --> 01:07:19.702
Suppose he doesn't come back again?

01:07:19.786 --> 01:07:22.413
He'll be back. His things are still there.

01:07:23.623 --> 01:07:25.583
Well, I guess it's safe
to put on some lights now.

01:07:25.625 --> 01:07:27.126
No, not yet!

01:07:34.134 --> 01:07:38.554
Okay, you can turn it on now. He must
have gone someplace to the right.

01:07:39.681 --> 01:07:43.016
All day long, I've been trying
to keep my mind on my work.

01:07:43.101 --> 01:07:44.727
Thinking about Thorwald?

01:07:44.811 --> 01:07:46.979
And you and your friend, Doyle.

01:07:47.480 --> 01:07:49.481
Did you hear from him
again, since he left?

01:07:49.566 --> 01:07:50.566
Not a word.

01:07:50.650 --> 01:07:53.235
He said he was gonna check the
railroad station and the trunk.

01:07:53.319 --> 01:07:55.195
He must be still at it.

01:07:55.864 --> 01:07:57.823
Something on your mind?

01:07:58.533 --> 01:08:00.075
It doesn't make sense to me.

01:08:00.160 --> 01:08:01.618
What doesn't?

01:08:02.078 --> 01:08:04.496
Women aren't that unpredictable.

01:08:04.956 --> 01:08:05.998
Mmm.

01:08:06.082 --> 01:08:09.209
Well, I can't guess
what you're thinking.

01:08:09.294 --> 01:08:11.670
A woman has a favorite handbag

01:08:11.755 --> 01:08:15.883
and it always hangs on her bedpost,
where she can get at it easily.

01:08:15.967 --> 01:08:19.970
And then, all of a sudden, she goes away
on a trip and leaves it behind. Why?

01:08:20.054 --> 01:08:21.722
Because she didn't know
she was going on a trip.

01:08:21.806 --> 01:08:23.886
And where she's going, she
wouldn't need the handbag.

01:08:23.892 --> 01:08:26.769
Yes, but only her husband
would know that.

01:08:28.021 --> 01:08:29.271
And that jewelry.

01:08:29.355 --> 01:08:31.148
Women don't keep their
jewelry in a purse

01:08:31.232 --> 01:08:33.734
getting all twisted and
scratched and tangled up.

01:08:33.818 --> 01:08:35.402
Well, do they hide it in
their husband's clothes?

01:08:35.487 --> 01:08:37.070
They do not.

01:08:37.155 --> 01:08:39.865
And they don't leave
it behind, either.

01:08:40.283 --> 01:08:42.326
Why, a woman going
anywhere but the hospital

01:08:42.410 --> 01:08:45.412
would always take makeup,
perfume and jewelry.

01:08:46.998 --> 01:08:48.874
Put that over there.
That's inside stuff, huh?

01:08:48.958 --> 01:08:50.584
It's basic equipment.

01:08:50.668 --> 01:08:53.545
And you don't leave it behind
in your husband's drawer

01:08:53.630 --> 01:08:55.088
in your favorite handbag.

01:08:55.173 --> 01:08:57.466
Well, I'm with you,
sweetie. I'm with you.

01:08:57.550 --> 01:08:59.510
Tom Doyle has a pat
answer for that, though.

01:08:59.594 --> 01:09:01.553
That Mrs. Thorwald
left at 6:00 a.m.

01:09:01.638 --> 01:09:02.721
Yesterday with her husband?

01:09:02.806 --> 01:09:04.473
According to those witnesses.

01:09:04.557 --> 01:09:06.809
Well, I have a pat
rebuttal for Mr. Doyle.

01:09:06.893 --> 01:09:10.729
That couldn't have been Mrs.
Thorwald, or I don't know women.

01:09:10.814 --> 01:09:12.856
What about the witnesses?

01:09:12.941 --> 01:09:15.192
We'll agree they saw a woman,

01:09:15.735 --> 01:09:17.986
but she was not
Mrs. Thorwald.

01:09:18.363 --> 01:09:20.656
That is, not yet.

01:09:20.740 --> 01:09:21.740
Is that so?

01:09:25.912 --> 01:09:27.329
Come here.

01:09:30.750 --> 01:09:34.169
I'd like to see your friend's
face when we tell him.

01:09:34.254 --> 01:09:36.463
He doesn't sound like
much of a detective.

01:09:36.548 --> 01:09:40.008
Oh, don't be too hard on him.
He's a steady worker.

01:09:41.469 --> 01:09:43.595
I sure wish he'd show up.

01:09:43.680 --> 01:09:46.265
Don't rush him.
We have all night.

01:09:48.852 --> 01:09:50.894
- We have all what?
- Night.

01:09:51.437 --> 01:09:53.605
I'm going to stay with you.

01:09:55.567 --> 01:09:58.819
Well, you'll have to clear
that with my landlord.

01:09:59.737 --> 01:10:01.947
I have the whole weekend off.

01:10:02.907 --> 01:10:05.826
That's very nice, but
I just have one bed.

01:10:06.536 --> 01:10:10.163
If you say anything else, I'll
stay tomorrow night, too.

01:10:11.082 --> 01:10:14.126
I won't be able to
give you any pajamas.

01:10:19.549 --> 01:10:22.676
You said I'll have to
live out of one suitcase.

01:10:25.054 --> 01:10:27.097
I'll bet yours isn't this small.

01:10:27.181 --> 01:10:28.807
This is a suitcase?

01:10:28.892 --> 01:10:31.810
Well, a Mark Cross
overnight case, anyway.

01:10:32.270 --> 01:10:35.397
Compact, but ample enough.

01:10:35.481 --> 01:10:37.733
Looks like you
packed in a hurry.

01:10:37.817 --> 01:10:40.319
Look at this.
Isn't that amazing?

01:10:41.154 --> 01:10:42.779
I'll trade you...

01:10:42.864 --> 01:10:45.949
My feminine intuition
for a bed for the night.

01:10:46.034 --> 01:10:48.118
I'll go along with that.

01:11:01.925 --> 01:11:04.051
There's that song again.

01:11:10.683 --> 01:11:14.353
Where does a man get inspiration
to write a song like that?

01:11:14.437 --> 01:11:17.522
Well, he gets it from the
landlady once a month.

01:11:20.610 --> 01:11:22.569
It's utterly beautiful.

01:11:23.404 --> 01:11:25.072
I wish I could be creative.

01:11:25.156 --> 01:11:26.865
Oh, sweetie, you are.

01:11:27.784 --> 01:11:31.286
You have a great talent for
creating difficult situations.

01:11:31.371 --> 01:11:32.663
- I do?
- Sure.

01:11:32.747 --> 01:11:35.123
Like staying here
all night uninvited.

01:11:35.208 --> 01:11:38.543
Surprise is the most
important element of attack.

01:11:38.628 --> 01:11:41.755
And besides, you're not up on
your private eye literature.

01:11:41.839 --> 01:11:43.966
When they're in trouble, it's
always their Girl Friday

01:11:44.050 --> 01:11:45.384
who gets them out of it.

01:11:45.468 --> 01:11:47.636
Is she the girl that saves
them from the clutches

01:11:47.720 --> 01:11:49.179
of the seductive showgirls

01:11:49.263 --> 01:11:51.473
and the over-passionate
daughters of the rich?

01:11:51.557 --> 01:11:53.642
The same.
That's the one, huh?

01:11:53.726 --> 01:11:57.479
It's funny. He never ends
up marrying her, does he?

01:11:57.563 --> 01:11:58.730
That's strange.

01:11:58.815 --> 01:11:59.940
Weird.

01:12:03.069 --> 01:12:05.278
Why don't I slip into
something more comfortable?

01:12:05.363 --> 01:12:07.072
By all means.

01:12:07.156 --> 01:12:09.992
I mean, like the kitchen
and make us some coffee.

01:12:10.076 --> 01:12:12.577
Oh, and some brandy, too, huh?

01:12:22.338 --> 01:12:23.672
Harry.

01:12:33.099 --> 01:12:34.474
- Jeff.
- Hi.

01:13:26.944 --> 01:13:28.737
What else have you got
on this man Thorwald?

01:13:28.821 --> 01:13:32.240
Well, enough to scare me you wouldn't
show up in time and we'd lose him.

01:13:32.325 --> 01:13:33.283
Think he's getting out of here?

01:13:33.367 --> 01:13:34.826
Look, he's got
everything he owns

01:13:34.911 --> 01:13:38.497
laid out over there in the
bedroom, waiting to be packed.

01:13:40.374 --> 01:13:44.002
I'm just warming some brandy.
Mr. Doyle, I presume?

01:13:46.631 --> 01:13:48.757
Tom, this is Miss Lisa Fremont.

01:13:48.841 --> 01:13:49.841
How do you do?

01:13:50.676 --> 01:13:52.886
We think Thorwald's guilty.

01:13:59.852 --> 01:14:01.520
Careful, Tom.

01:14:06.984 --> 01:14:08.065
- Hello.
<i>- Lieutenant Doyle.</i>

01:14:08.111 --> 01:14:10.487
Yeah, he's right here. For you.

01:14:11.364 --> 01:14:13.406
- Hello.
<i>- Lieutenant Doyle, sir?</i>

01:14:13.491 --> 01:14:14.783
Speaking.

01:14:15.827 --> 01:14:17.160
Yeah.

01:14:19.205 --> 01:14:20.539
All right.

01:14:20.873 --> 01:14:23.125
I see. Thank you. Goodbye.

01:14:23.626 --> 01:14:25.794
Coffee will be ready soon.

01:14:25.878 --> 01:14:28.630
Jeff, aren't you going to
tell him about the jewelry?

01:14:28.714 --> 01:14:29.756
Jewelry?

01:14:29.841 --> 01:14:33.218
He's got his wife's jewelry hidden in
his clothes in the bedroom over there.

01:14:33.302 --> 01:14:34.427
You sure it belonged to his wife?

01:14:34.512 --> 01:14:36.555
It was in her favorite handbag.

01:14:36.639 --> 01:14:39.307
Mr. Doyle, that can only
lead to one conclusion.

01:14:39.392 --> 01:14:40.433
Namely?

01:14:40.518 --> 01:14:44.479
That it was not Mrs. Thorwald that
left with him yesterday morning.

01:14:44.564 --> 01:14:45.981
You figured that out, eh?

01:14:46.065 --> 01:14:48.525
Well, it's simply that women
don't leave their jewelry behind

01:14:48.609 --> 01:14:50.610
when they go on a trip.

01:14:50.903 --> 01:14:51.903
Come on, come on, Tom.

01:14:51.988 --> 01:14:55.615
Now you don't really need any
of this information, do you?

01:15:01.497 --> 01:15:03.748
As a matter of fact, I don't.

01:15:09.630 --> 01:15:12.924
Lars Thorwald is no more
a murderer than I am.

01:15:16.888 --> 01:15:19.514
You mean to say you can explain
everything that's gone on over there,

01:15:19.599 --> 01:15:20.891
and is still going on?

01:15:20.975 --> 01:15:22.851
No, neither can you.

01:15:22.935 --> 01:15:25.937
That's a secret, private world
you're looking into out there.

01:15:26.022 --> 01:15:29.062
People do a lot of things in private they
couldn't possibly explain in public.

01:15:29.066 --> 01:15:30.942
Like disposing of their wives?

01:15:31.027 --> 01:15:33.778
You get that idea out of your mind.
It'll only lead in the wrong direction.

01:15:33.863 --> 01:15:36.323
What about the
knife and the saw?

01:15:36.407 --> 01:15:37.991
Did you ever own a saw?

01:15:38.075 --> 01:15:40.744
Well, at home in
the garage I had...

01:15:40.828 --> 01:15:43.121
How many people
did you cut up with it?

01:15:43.206 --> 01:15:47.626
Or with the couple of hundred knives
you've probably owned in your lifetime?

01:15:48.377 --> 01:15:50.045
Well, your logic is backward.

01:15:50.129 --> 01:15:54.007
You can't ignore the wife disappearing
and the trunk and the jewelry.

01:15:54.091 --> 01:15:56.843
I checked the railroad station.
He bought a ticket.

01:15:56.928 --> 01:15:58.887
Ten minutes later, he put
his wife on a train.

01:15:58.971 --> 01:16:02.098
Destination, Merritsville.
The witnesses are that deep.

01:16:02.183 --> 01:16:05.227
That might have been a woman, but it
couldn't have been Mrs. Thorwald.

01:16:05.311 --> 01:16:06.853
- That jewelry...
- Look, Miss Fremont.

01:16:06.938 --> 01:16:09.731
That feminine intuition
stuff sells magazines.

01:16:09.815 --> 01:16:12.776
But in real life,
it's still a fairy tale.

01:16:12.860 --> 01:16:14.620
I don't know how many
wasted years I've spent

01:16:14.654 --> 01:16:17.239
tracking down leads based
on female intuition.

01:16:17.323 --> 01:16:19.950
All right. I take it you
didn't find the trunk,

01:16:20.034 --> 01:16:23.536
and all this is from an old speech you
once made at the Policemen's Ball.

01:16:23.621 --> 01:16:26.122
I found the trunk a half-hour
after I left here.

01:16:26.207 --> 01:16:29.876
I suppose it's normal for a man to
tie up a trunk with heavy rope?

01:16:29.961 --> 01:16:31.962
Well, if the lock
is broken, yes.

01:16:32.046 --> 01:16:35.173
And what did you find inside the trunk?
A surly note to me?

01:16:35.258 --> 01:16:37.342
Mrs. Thorwald's clothes.

01:16:37.426 --> 01:16:40.845
Clean, well packed.
Not stylish, but presentable.

01:16:40.930 --> 01:16:42.764
Didn't you take them
off to the crime lab?

01:16:42.848 --> 01:16:45.725
I sent them on their
merry and legal way.

01:16:45.810 --> 01:16:48.603
Why, when a woman is taking
a simple, short trip,

01:16:48.688 --> 01:16:50.605
does she take
everything she owns?

01:16:50.690 --> 01:16:54.401
Let's let the female psychology
department handle that one.

01:16:55.361 --> 01:16:57.821
I would say it looked as
if she wasn't coming back.

01:16:57.905 --> 01:16:59.614
That's what's known
as a family problem.

01:16:59.699 --> 01:17:02.534
And if she wasn't coming back,
why didn't he tell his landlord?

01:17:02.618 --> 01:17:07.414
I'll tell you why he didn't tell his
landlord. Because he was hiding something.

01:17:09.500 --> 01:17:12.002
Do you tell your
landlord everything?

01:17:12.086 --> 01:17:13.795
I told you to be careful, Tom.

01:17:13.879 --> 01:17:17.080
Look, if I'd have been careful piloting
that reconnaissance plane during the war,

01:17:17.133 --> 01:17:18.633
you wouldn't have had the
chance to take the pictures

01:17:18.718 --> 01:17:23.138
that won you a medal, and a
good job, and fame and money.

01:17:25.433 --> 01:17:30.020
What do you say we all sit down and
have a nice, friendly drink, too? Hmm?

01:17:30.813 --> 01:17:32.731
Forget all about this.

01:17:33.399 --> 01:17:36.985
We can tell lies about the
good old days during the war.

01:17:37.945 --> 01:17:40.030
You mean you're through
with the case?

01:17:40.114 --> 01:17:42.949
There is no case to be
through with, Miss Fremont.

01:17:43.034 --> 01:17:44.909
How about that drink?

01:17:52.501 --> 01:17:54.627
Yeah, I guess you're right.

01:17:55.880 --> 01:17:59.257
Well, I think I better get
home and get some sleep.

01:18:00.843 --> 01:18:02.260
Cheers.

01:18:06.724 --> 01:18:08.808
Not much of a snifter.

01:18:13.564 --> 01:18:16.191
Oh, Jeff, if you
need any more help...

01:18:16.275 --> 01:18:19.778
Consult the Yellow Pages
in your telephone directory.

01:18:20.446 --> 01:18:23.114
Oh, I love funny exiting lines.

01:18:24.200 --> 01:18:25.867
Who was that trunk addressed to?

01:18:25.951 --> 01:18:27.410
Mrs. Anna Thorwald.

01:18:27.495 --> 01:18:30.038
Well, then let's wait and
find out who picks it up.

01:18:30.122 --> 01:18:32.540
Oh, that telephone call.
I gave them your number.

01:18:32.625 --> 01:18:33.958
I hope you don't mind.

01:18:34.043 --> 01:18:35.543
Depends on who they were.

01:18:35.628 --> 01:18:37.212
The police at Merritsville.

01:18:37.296 --> 01:18:39.464
They reported the trunk
was just picked up

01:18:39.548 --> 01:18:41.508
by Mrs. Anna Thorwald.

01:18:42.426 --> 01:18:44.844
Don't stay up too late.

01:19:03.155 --> 01:19:05.073
- Look.
- What?

01:19:37.064 --> 01:19:39.649
Yeah, he's kind of young, isn't he?

01:20:15.519 --> 01:20:17.270
What are you doing?

01:20:43.589 --> 01:20:48.218
You know, much as I hate to give Thomas J.
Doyle too much credit,

01:20:48.302 --> 01:20:50.595
he might have gotten a hold
of something when he said

01:20:50.679 --> 01:20:53.848
that was pretty private
stuff going on out there.

01:20:55.601 --> 01:21:00.772
I wonder if it's ethical to watch a man
with binoculars and a long-focus lens.

01:21:02.608 --> 01:21:05.527
Do you... Do you
suppose it's ethical,

01:21:05.611 --> 01:21:08.780
even if you prove that he
didn't commit a crime?

01:21:10.366 --> 01:21:13.034
I'm not much on
rear-window ethics.

01:21:13.118 --> 01:21:14.702
Of course, they can
do the same thing to me.

01:21:14.787 --> 01:21:18.289
Watch me like a bug under
a glass, if they want to.

01:21:18.374 --> 01:21:21.876
Jeff, you know, if someone came in here,
they wouldn't believe what they'd see.

01:21:21.961 --> 01:21:22.961
What?

01:21:23.045 --> 01:21:24.254
You and me with long faces.

01:21:24.338 --> 01:21:28.841
Plunged into despair because we find
out a man didn't kill his wife.

01:21:28.926 --> 01:21:32.387
We're two of the most frightening
ghouls I've ever known.

01:21:32.471 --> 01:21:37.433
You'd think we could be a little bit happy
that the poor woman is alive and well.

01:21:39.979 --> 01:21:43.314
Whatever happened to that old
saying, "Love thy neighbor"?

01:21:44.984 --> 01:21:48.361
You know, I think I'll start
reviving that tomorrow.

01:21:49.572 --> 01:21:51.990
Yeah, I'll begin
with Miss Torso.

01:21:52.825 --> 01:21:56.703
Not if I have to move into
an apartment across the way

01:21:58.330 --> 01:22:01.499
and do the Dance of the
Seven Veils every hour.

01:22:04.461 --> 01:22:06.462
Show's over for tonight.

01:22:11.594 --> 01:22:13.928
Preview of coming attractions.

01:22:16.348 --> 01:22:19.058
Did Mr. Doyle think
I stole this case?

01:22:20.519 --> 01:22:23.396
No, Lisa, I don't think he did.

01:22:38.412 --> 01:22:40.330
What do you think?

01:22:40.414 --> 01:22:41.414
Well...

01:22:42.666 --> 01:22:44.751
I will rephrase the question.

01:22:44.835 --> 01:22:46.085
Thank you.

01:22:47.171 --> 01:22:48.755
Do you like it?

01:22:49.548 --> 01:22:50.923
Yes, I like it.

01:22:51.592 --> 01:22:53.968
Well...

01:23:02.603 --> 01:23:04.312
What's the matter?

01:23:07.066 --> 01:23:09.108
- Somebody's hurt?
- It's the dog.

01:23:09.193 --> 01:23:11.694
Something's happened to the dog.

01:23:14.448 --> 01:23:17.659
What's the trouble?
Somebody fall out a window?

01:23:18.327 --> 01:23:20.620
See, it's a dog down there.

01:23:21.580 --> 01:23:22.955
It's dead.

01:23:23.540 --> 01:23:26.376
It's been strangled.
The neck is broken.

01:23:27.211 --> 01:23:29.003
Which one of you did it?

01:23:29.088 --> 01:23:31.506
Which one of you killed my dog?

01:23:33.217 --> 01:23:36.010
You don't know the meaning
of the word "Neighbors."

01:23:36.512 --> 01:23:40.056
Neighbors like each other,
speak to each other,

01:23:40.140 --> 01:23:42.475
care if anybody lives or dies.

01:23:43.185 --> 01:23:44.977
But none of you do!

01:23:48.899 --> 01:23:51.359
But I couldn't imagine
any of you being so low

01:23:51.443 --> 01:23:54.821
that you'd kill a little
helpless, friendly dog.

01:23:56.990 --> 01:24:00.868
The only thing in this whole
neighborhood who liked anybody.

01:24:09.169 --> 01:24:11.921
Did you kill him
because he liked you?

01:24:12.005 --> 01:24:14.173
Just because he liked you?

01:24:16.969 --> 01:24:18.636
Let's go inside.

01:24:22.808 --> 01:24:25.727
Come on. Let's go back in.
It's only a dog.

01:24:38.073 --> 01:24:42.076
You know, for a minute, that Tom Doyle
almost had me convinced I was wrong.

01:24:42.161 --> 01:24:44.078
- But you're not?
- Look.

01:24:44.163 --> 01:24:48.374
In the whole courtyard, only one
person didn't come to the window.

01:24:48.459 --> 01:24:49.667
Look.

01:24:55.048 --> 01:24:58.426
Why would Thorwald want
to kill a little dog?

01:25:00.304 --> 01:25:02.305
Because it knew too much?

01:25:10.355 --> 01:25:13.399
You think this is worth
waiting all day to see?

01:25:13.901 --> 01:25:15.443
Is he cleaning house?

01:25:15.527 --> 01:25:18.112
He's washing down
the bathroom walls.

01:25:18.197 --> 01:25:19.238
Hmm.

01:25:19.323 --> 01:25:21.449
Must have splattered a lot.

01:25:22.993 --> 01:25:25.703
Well, why not? That's
what we're all thinking.

01:25:25.788 --> 01:25:28.668
He killed her in there, he has to clean
up those stains before he leaves.

01:25:28.707 --> 01:25:31.375
Oh, Stella, your
choice of words.

01:25:31.460 --> 01:25:34.879
Nobody ever invented a polite
word for a killing yet.

01:25:37.966 --> 01:25:42.970
Lisa? Lisa, back there, on that shelf,
there's a little yellow box. You see it?

01:25:43.055 --> 01:25:44.806
- Top one?
- Right on top, yeah.

01:25:44.890 --> 01:25:47.391
Bring it. And bring
me the viewer there.

01:25:49.269 --> 01:25:50.853
I just got a...

01:25:51.563 --> 01:25:54.315
Now, these are
about two weeks old.

01:25:54.399 --> 01:25:58.069
I hope I took something else
besides leg art. Now which one...

01:25:58.153 --> 01:26:00.530
- What are you looking for?
- Here.

01:26:00.989 --> 01:26:04.200
There's something, and if I'm right,
I think I've solved a murder.

01:26:04.284 --> 01:26:06.077
- Mrs. Thorwald?
- No.

01:26:07.246 --> 01:26:09.288
No, the dog.

01:26:10.457 --> 01:26:11.624
Uh-huh.

01:26:11.708 --> 01:26:14.710
I think I know why
Thorwald killed that dog.

01:26:15.254 --> 01:26:18.381
Here, now you take a look.
Tell me what you see.

01:26:18.715 --> 01:26:20.341
Now take it down.

01:26:20.843 --> 01:26:24.470
Now look again. Now take it down.
You see?

01:26:25.597 --> 01:26:28.140
But it's just a picture
of the backyard, that's all.

01:26:28.225 --> 01:26:32.228
One important change.
One important change.

01:26:33.063 --> 01:26:36.274
Those flowers in
Thorwald's pet flower bed.

01:26:37.192 --> 01:26:39.277
You mean where the dog
was sniffing around?

01:26:39.361 --> 01:26:42.822
Where the dog was digging.
Now look at those flowers.

01:26:43.240 --> 01:26:46.993
Look, right? Those two
yellow zinnias on this end

01:26:47.077 --> 01:26:48.911
aren't as tall as they were.

01:26:48.996 --> 01:26:52.331
Now, since when do flowers
grow shorter in two weeks?

01:26:52.416 --> 01:26:53.875
There's something buried there.

01:26:53.959 --> 01:26:55.668
Mrs. Thorwald.

01:26:56.295 --> 01:26:59.547
You haven't spent much time
around cemeteries, have you?

01:26:59.631 --> 01:27:02.675
Mr. Thorwald could scarcely
put his wife's body

01:27:02.759 --> 01:27:05.720
in a plot of ground
about one foot square.

01:27:05.804 --> 01:27:08.639
Unless, of course, he put
her in standing on end,

01:27:08.724 --> 01:27:11.434
and then he wouldn't
need a knife and saw.

01:27:11.518 --> 01:27:15.187
No, my idea is she's
scattered all over town.

01:27:15.272 --> 01:27:17.565
- Leg in the East River...
- Oh, Stella, please!

01:27:17.649 --> 01:27:19.066
No, no, no. There's
something in there.

01:27:19.151 --> 01:27:21.736
Those flowers have been
taken out and put back in.

01:27:21.820 --> 01:27:23.696
Maybe it's the knife and saw.
Yeah.

01:27:23.780 --> 01:27:24.822
Call Lieutenant Doyle.

01:27:24.907 --> 01:27:26.073
No, let's wait.

01:27:26.158 --> 01:27:29.911
Let's wait till it gets a little darker,
and I'll go over there and dig them up.

01:27:29.995 --> 01:27:33.998
You'll go? You won't dig anything
up and get your neck broken.

01:27:34.625 --> 01:27:36.292
No, no, we've...

01:27:36.752 --> 01:27:40.129
We're not gonna call Doyle until I
can produce Mrs. Thorwald's body.

01:27:40.213 --> 01:27:43.049
What we've got to do is find a
way to get into that apartment.

01:27:43.133 --> 01:27:44.592
He's packing.

01:27:45.844 --> 01:27:46.969
Uh-oh.

01:27:47.054 --> 01:27:49.347
Here, get me a pencil.

01:27:50.265 --> 01:27:53.559
Stella, get me some note paper.
It's up here someplace.

01:27:53.644 --> 01:27:55.186
There it is.

01:29:11.847 --> 01:29:14.682
You did it, Thorwald.
You did it.

01:29:18.729 --> 01:29:19.812
Look out, Lisa.
He's coming.

01:29:19.896 --> 01:29:21.981
You never should have let her do it.
If he ever...

01:29:22.065 --> 01:29:23.357
Look. Look. Look.

01:29:43.295 --> 01:29:45.713
Well, thank heaven that's over.

01:29:48.967 --> 01:29:49.925
All right if I have a drink?

01:29:50.010 --> 01:29:51.594
Sure, go ahead.

01:30:00.145 --> 01:30:04.065
There's no doubt about it. He's leaving.
It's just a question of when.

01:30:04.149 --> 01:30:06.817
Mind if I use that
portable keyhole?

01:30:08.111 --> 01:30:11.989
Go ahead, just as long as you
tell me what you're looking at.

01:30:17.996 --> 01:30:18.996
I wonder...

01:30:19.081 --> 01:30:20.206
Wonder what?

01:30:20.290 --> 01:30:22.166
Miss Lonelyheart's
just laid out something

01:30:22.250 --> 01:30:24.877
that looks like rhodium
tri-eckonal capsules.

01:30:24.961 --> 01:30:26.253
You can tell from here?

01:30:26.338 --> 01:30:29.298
I've handled enough of those red
pills to put everybody in Hackensack

01:30:29.382 --> 01:30:30.674
to sleep for the winter.

01:30:30.759 --> 01:30:32.426
Well, does she have
enough of them to...

01:30:32.511 --> 01:30:34.512
No. It will make
the rest easy to...

01:30:35.263 --> 01:30:37.014
Wasn't that close?

01:30:37.641 --> 01:30:40.768
What was his reaction. I mean,
when he looked at the note?

01:30:40.852 --> 01:30:44.772
Well, it wasn't the kind of an expression
that would get him a quick loan at the bank.

01:30:44.856 --> 01:30:46.690
Jeff, the handbag!

01:31:12.008 --> 01:31:14.343
Suppose Mrs. Thorwald's
wedding ring

01:31:14.427 --> 01:31:17.429
is among the jewelry
he has in that handbag?

01:31:17.514 --> 01:31:20.099
Now, during the phone conversation
he held up three rings.

01:31:20.183 --> 01:31:23.519
One with a diamond, one with
a big stone of some sort

01:31:23.603 --> 01:31:25.479
and then just a plain gold band.

01:31:25.564 --> 01:31:29.650
And the last thing she would leave
behind would be a wedding ring.

01:31:29.734 --> 01:31:31.944
Stella, do you ever
leave yours at home?

01:31:32.028 --> 01:31:36.490
The only way anybody could get that
ring would be to chop off my finger.

01:31:39.494 --> 01:31:42.663
Let's go down and find out
what's buried in the garden.

01:31:42.747 --> 01:31:47.126
Why not? I've always wanted to meet Mrs.
Thorwald.

01:31:47.252 --> 01:31:48.836
- What are you two talking about?
- You got a shovel?

01:31:48.920 --> 01:31:50.171
A shovel? Of course I
don't have a shovel.

01:31:50.255 --> 01:31:52.047
There's probably
one in the basement.

01:31:52.132 --> 01:31:54.175
Jeff, if you're squeamish,
just don't look.

01:31:54.259 --> 01:31:55.551
Squeamish?
I'm not squeamish.

01:31:55.635 --> 01:31:59.180
I just don't want you two to end up
like that dog ended up. That's all.

01:31:59.264 --> 01:32:02.516
Oh, you know, Miss Fremont, he
might just have something there.

01:32:02.601 --> 01:32:04.685
Just hold on.
Here, take this.

01:32:04.769 --> 01:32:07.104
No sense taking any
chances in this thing.

01:32:07.189 --> 01:32:09.440
Here, give me the phone book.

01:32:10.609 --> 01:32:11.859
What for?

01:32:12.611 --> 01:32:14.570
Maybe I can get him
out of that apartment.

01:32:14.654 --> 01:32:16.155
We only need a few minutes.

01:32:16.239 --> 01:32:17.948
I'll see if I can
get about 15 minutes.

01:32:18.033 --> 01:32:19.074
How?

01:32:19.159 --> 01:32:20.159
Thorwald.

01:32:21.786 --> 01:32:24.622
Thorwald...
Thorwald...

01:32:26.082 --> 01:32:29.418
Chelsea 27099.

01:32:30.337 --> 01:32:31.879
27099.

01:32:31.963 --> 01:32:35.132
We scared him once, maybe
we can scare him again.

01:32:35.884 --> 01:32:38.886
Well, I guess I'm using that
word "we" a little freely.

01:32:38.970 --> 01:32:40.930
I mean, you're taking
all the chances.

01:32:41.014 --> 01:32:42.932
Shall we vote him in, Stella?

01:32:43.016 --> 01:32:44.058
Unanimously.

01:32:44.142 --> 01:32:46.435
27099. Look out.

01:32:49.731 --> 01:32:54.401
Chelsea.

01:33:12.379 --> 01:33:14.588
Go on, pick it up, Thorwald.

01:33:15.590 --> 01:33:17.466
Go on, you're curious.

01:33:18.343 --> 01:33:21.595
You wonder if it's your girlfriend
calling, the one you killed for.

01:33:21.680 --> 01:33:23.347
Go on, pick it up.

01:33:27.644 --> 01:33:28.811
<i>Hello?</i>

01:33:29.771 --> 01:33:31.647
Did you get my note?

01:33:33.692 --> 01:33:35.901
Well, did you get it, Thorwald?

01:33:35.986 --> 01:33:37.152
<i>Who are you?</i>

01:33:37.237 --> 01:33:39.446
I'll give you a
chance to find out.

01:33:39.531 --> 01:33:42.283
Meet me in the bar
at the Albert Hotel.

01:33:42.367 --> 01:33:44.118
Do it right away.

01:33:44.202 --> 01:33:45.786
<i>Why should I?</i>

01:33:45.870 --> 01:33:47.413
A little business meeting...

01:33:48.164 --> 01:33:50.874
To settle the estate
of your late wife.

01:33:51.293 --> 01:33:54.920
<i>I don't know what you mean.</i>

01:33:55.005 --> 01:33:59.425
Come on. Quit stalling, Thorwald, or
I'll hang up and call the police.

01:33:59.759 --> 01:34:01.677
<i>I have only $100 or so.</i>

01:34:01.761 --> 01:34:03.053
That's a start.

01:34:03.555 --> 01:34:07.224
I'm at the Albert now.
I'll be looking for you.

01:34:26.703 --> 01:34:28.329
Come on, Stella, let's go.

01:34:28.413 --> 01:34:29.997
One of you keep an
eye on this window.

01:34:30.081 --> 01:34:33.667
If I see him coming back,
I'll signal with a flashbulb.

01:36:08.179 --> 01:36:09.847
<i>This is the Doyle residence.</i>

01:36:09.931 --> 01:36:14.143
Hello, this is L.B. Jefferies speaking.
I'm a friend of Mr. Doyle.

01:36:14.436 --> 01:36:15.436
Who's this?

01:36:15.520 --> 01:36:16.645
<i>This is a babysitter.</i>

01:36:16.729 --> 01:36:18.188
Oh. Uh...

01:36:18.273 --> 01:36:19.523
When do you expect them in?

01:36:19.607 --> 01:36:24.153
<i>Well, I'm hired till 1:00. They went
to dinner and maybe a nightclub.</i>

01:36:24.529 --> 01:36:25.863
I see.

01:36:26.364 --> 01:36:29.992
If he calls in, would you have him get
in touch with L.B. Jefferies right away?

01:36:30.076 --> 01:36:31.994
I might have quite a surprise for him.

01:36:32.078 --> 01:36:34.997
<i>Well, do we have your number, Mr.
Jefferies?</i>

01:36:35.081 --> 01:36:37.207
He has it. Good night.

01:36:37.292 --> 01:36:38.750
<i>Good night.</i>

01:36:56.728 --> 01:36:59.521
Stella was wrong about Miss Lonelyheart.

01:37:31.387 --> 01:37:33.805
Lisa, what are you... Don't do...

01:37:49.948 --> 01:37:52.616
Lisa, what are you doing? Don't go...

01:38:26.442 --> 01:38:29.069
Come on, come on! Get out of there!

01:38:35.326 --> 01:38:39.204
She said ring Thorwald's phone the
second you see him come back.

01:38:39.289 --> 01:38:40.247
I'm gonna ring it right now!

01:38:40.331 --> 01:38:43.083
Oh, no. Give her another minute.

01:38:46.337 --> 01:38:48.922
All right, fellows, let's try
it once from the beginning.

01:38:49.007 --> 01:38:50.757
Miss Lonelyheart.

01:38:50.842 --> 01:38:52.718
Oh, call the police!

01:38:55.096 --> 01:38:56.096
<i>Operator.</i>

01:38:56.180 --> 01:38:58.265
Get me the police, sixth precinct.

01:38:58.349 --> 01:38:59.683
<i>Yes, sir.</i>

01:39:11.863 --> 01:39:14.573
Mr. Jefferies, the music stopped her.

01:39:22.081 --> 01:39:23.790
What... Lisa!

01:39:26.210 --> 01:39:27.377
Lisa!

01:39:38.640 --> 01:39:40.349
<i>Precinct 6, Sergeant Allgood.</i>

01:39:40.433 --> 01:39:45.604
Hello. Hello. Look, a man is assaulting
a woman at 125 West 9th Street.

01:39:45.688 --> 01:39:49.232
Second floor, at the rear. Make it fast!

01:39:49.317 --> 01:39:50.317
<i>Your name?</i>

01:39:50.401 --> 01:39:52.027
L.B. Jefferies.

01:39:52.111 --> 01:39:53.111
<i>Phone number?</i>

01:39:53.196 --> 01:39:55.489
Chelsea 25598.

01:40:16.094 --> 01:40:17.761
The door was open.

01:40:39.784 --> 01:40:41.827
I told you... Oh, no!

01:40:43.705 --> 01:40:45.706
Let go of me! Jeff!

01:40:45.790 --> 01:40:46.998
Oh, no!

01:40:47.083 --> 01:40:48.625
Jeff! Jeff!

01:40:49.127 --> 01:40:50.210
Jeff!

01:40:51.754 --> 01:40:52.963
Lisa!

01:40:53.965 --> 01:40:56.550
Stella, what do we do?

01:40:56.634 --> 01:40:57.843
Jeff!

01:40:58.636 --> 01:41:00.887
- Jeff!
- Well, here they come.

01:41:50.938 --> 01:41:53.148
What's she trying to do? Why
doesn't she turn him in?

01:41:53.232 --> 01:41:54.566
She's a smart girl.

01:41:54.650 --> 01:41:56.290
"Smart girl"? She'll
get herself arrested.

01:41:56.360 --> 01:41:59.029
It'll get her out
of there, won't it?

01:42:01.699 --> 01:42:03.617
Look, the wedding ring!

01:42:09.415 --> 01:42:11.875
Turn off the light!
He's seen us!

01:42:21.803 --> 01:42:23.470
How long do you think he'll stay there?

01:42:23.554 --> 01:42:27.641
Well, unless he's dumber than I think he
is, he won't wait until his lease is up.

01:42:27.725 --> 01:42:29.805
Get my billfold out of the
drawer in the table there.

01:42:29.811 --> 01:42:31.019
What do you need money for?

01:42:31.103 --> 01:42:32.687
I'm gonna bail Lisa out of jail.

01:42:32.772 --> 01:42:35.106
You know, you could leave her
there till next Tuesday,

01:42:35.191 --> 01:42:37.651
then you could sneak
safely away as planned.

01:42:37.735 --> 01:42:41.655
Yeah, let's
see. $127.

01:42:41.739 --> 01:42:42.781
How much do you need?

01:42:42.865 --> 01:42:46.284
Well, this is first-offense
burglary, that's about $250.

01:42:46.369 --> 01:42:48.245
- Lisa's handbag.
- Yeah.

01:42:49.580 --> 01:42:50.664
How much does she have?

01:42:50.748 --> 01:42:52.040
Fifty cents.

01:42:52.124 --> 01:42:53.333
Here, take this.

01:42:53.417 --> 01:42:55.335
Look, I got $20 or so
in my purse.

01:42:55.419 --> 01:42:56.837
What about the rest?
What about the rest?

01:42:56.921 --> 01:42:59.464
When those cops see Lisa,
they'll even contribute.

01:42:59.549 --> 01:43:00.841
Well, hurry up.

01:43:05.096 --> 01:43:07.430
Just a minute.
Hurry up!

01:43:08.099 --> 01:43:09.099
Jefferies.

01:43:09.183 --> 01:43:10.851
<i>All right. What is it now?</i>

01:43:10.935 --> 01:43:14.104
Doyle, I've got something
really big for you.

01:43:14.188 --> 01:43:16.106
<i>Why did I have to return your call?</i>

01:43:16.190 --> 01:43:19.401
<i>Look, Jeff! Don't louse up my
night with another mad killer...</i>

01:43:19.485 --> 01:43:24.072
Listen to me! Listen to me! Lisa's in jail.
She got arrested.

01:43:24.448 --> 01:43:26.157
<i>- Your Lisa?</i>
- My Lisa.

01:43:26.242 --> 01:43:30.078
Boy, you should have seen her. She
got into Thorwald's apartment.

01:43:30.162 --> 01:43:33.331
But then he came back, and the only way I
could get her out was to call the police.

01:43:33.416 --> 01:43:35.041
<i>- I told you...</i>
- I know you told me!

01:43:35.126 --> 01:43:38.211
She went in to get evidence and
she came out with evidence.

01:43:38.296 --> 01:43:39.921
- Like what?
<i>- Like what?</i>

01:43:40.006 --> 01:43:42.924
Like Mrs. Thorwald's wedding ring.
That's like what.

01:43:43.009 --> 01:43:46.803
If that woman was alive, she'd
be wearing that ring. Right?

01:43:47.972 --> 01:43:50.015
<i>- A possibility.</i>
- A possibility. It's a fact!

01:43:50.099 --> 01:43:54.102
He killed a dog last night because the
dog was scratching around in the garden.

01:43:54.186 --> 01:43:58.356
You know why? Because he had something
buried in that garden that the dog scented.

01:43:58.441 --> 01:43:59.566
<i>Like an old ham bone?</i>

01:43:59.650 --> 01:44:02.736
Look, I don't know what pet names
Thorwald had for his wife,

01:44:02.820 --> 01:44:04.195
but I'll tell you this,

01:44:04.280 --> 01:44:07.532
all those trips at night
with that metal suitcase,

01:44:07.617 --> 01:44:09.242
he wasn't taking
out his possessions,

01:44:09.327 --> 01:44:12.746
because his possessions
are still up in the apartment.

01:44:12.830 --> 01:44:14.497
<i>Perhaps it was old "ham bone".</i>

01:44:14.582 --> 01:44:16.207
Yeah, in sections.

01:44:16.292 --> 01:44:17.626
And I'll tell you
something else.

01:44:17.710 --> 01:44:20.795
All the telephone calls he made
were long distance, all right?

01:44:20.880 --> 01:44:24.633
Now, if he called his wife long
distance on the day she left,

01:44:24.717 --> 01:44:26.927
after she arrived
in Merritsville,

01:44:27.011 --> 01:44:30.263
why did she write a card to him saying
that she'd arrived in Merritsville?

01:44:30.348 --> 01:44:32.182
Why did she do that?

01:44:32.934 --> 01:44:34.184
<i>Where'd they take Lisa?</i>

01:44:34.268 --> 01:44:35.268
Precinct 6.

01:44:35.353 --> 01:44:36.686
I sent somebody over
with the bail money.

01:44:36.771 --> 01:44:38.188
<i>Maybe you won't need it.</i>

01:44:38.272 --> 01:44:39.272
<i>I'll run it down, Jeff.</i>

01:44:39.357 --> 01:44:41.441
All right. All right.
Now hurry up, will you?

01:44:41.525 --> 01:44:43.360
This fellow knows
he's being watched.

01:44:43.444 --> 01:44:45.278
He's not gonna wait around forever.
Hurry up.

01:44:45.363 --> 01:44:47.364
<i>If that ring checks out,
we'll give him an escort.</i>

01:44:47.448 --> 01:44:49.574
<i>- So long, Jeff.</i>
- So long.

01:44:57.708 --> 01:45:01.544
Hello. Hello. Tom, I think Thorwald's left.
I don't see...

01:45:04.256 --> 01:45:05.632
Hello...

01:47:37.451 --> 01:47:39.452
What do you want from me?

01:47:43.374 --> 01:47:45.458
Your friend, the girl,
could have turned me in.

01:47:45.543 --> 01:47:47.085
Why didn't she?

01:47:49.213 --> 01:47:53.007
What is it you want? A lot of money?
I don't have any money.

01:47:56.720 --> 01:47:58.304
Say something.

01:48:00.057 --> 01:48:02.976
Say something! Tell me what you want!

01:48:06.105 --> 01:48:08.356
Can you get me that ring back?

01:48:09.525 --> 01:48:10.984
No.

01:48:11.068 --> 01:48:12.902
Tell her to bring it back!

01:48:12.987 --> 01:48:15.113
I can't. The police have it by now.

01:48:52.276 --> 01:48:54.110
Lisa! Doyle!

01:49:02.536 --> 01:49:03.953
Over there!

01:49:09.793 --> 01:49:12.295
Look! Look, over
in that apartment!

01:49:31.315 --> 01:49:32.649
Doyle!

01:49:36.737 --> 01:49:38.821
Creele! Give me your.38!

01:49:49.833 --> 01:49:51.584
I'm sorry, Jeff. I got
here as fast as I could!

01:49:51.669 --> 01:49:53.419
Oh, Mr. Jefferies! Don't
let anybody touch him.

01:49:53.504 --> 01:49:55.380
Get my medical
bag from upstairs.

01:49:55.464 --> 01:49:57.590
Oh, Lisa, sweetie, if anything
had happened to you...

01:49:57.675 --> 01:49:59.425
Oh, shut up. I'm all right.

01:49:59.510 --> 01:50:01.469
Gee, I'm proud of you!

01:50:02.513 --> 01:50:04.889
You got enough for
a search warrant now?

01:50:04.974 --> 01:50:06.140
Oh, yeah, sure.

01:50:06.225 --> 01:50:08.268
- Lieutenant Doyle!
- Yeah?

01:50:08.352 --> 01:50:09.435
Is he okay?

01:50:09.520 --> 01:50:10.561
He's alive.

01:50:10.646 --> 01:50:14.190
Thorwald's ready to take us
on a tour of the East River.

01:50:19.530 --> 01:50:21.698
Did he say what was
buried in the flower bed?

01:50:21.782 --> 01:50:25.910
Yeah. He said the dog got too
inquisitive, so he dug it up.

01:50:26.537 --> 01:50:29.372
It's in a hat box
over in his apartment.

01:50:29.873 --> 01:50:30.999
- Want to look?
- No, thanks.

01:50:31.083 --> 01:50:33.293
I don't want any part of her.

01:50:39.508 --> 01:50:42.302
I hope it's gonna be a hit.
This is the first release.

01:50:42.386 --> 01:50:44.304
I'd love to hear it.

01:50:44.388 --> 01:50:47.724
I can't tell you what this
music has meant to me.

01:51:03.157 --> 01:51:05.199
Now, let's try it again, puppy.

01:51:05.284 --> 01:51:07.493
Stay still. Stay.

01:51:15.294 --> 01:51:16.753
- Stanley!
- Hi, baby!

01:51:19.840 --> 01:51:22.633
My, look what the Army's done for you!

01:51:24.553 --> 01:51:28.598
The Army's made me hungry. What've
you got in the icebox to eat?

01:51:29.266 --> 01:51:31.351
Boy, it's good to be home.

01:51:34.772 --> 01:51:36.356
I don't care if
you help me or not,

01:51:36.440 --> 01:51:39.442
but if you'd told me you'd quit your
job, we wouldn't have gotten married.

01:51:39.526 --> 01:51:41.402
Oh, honey, come on...
