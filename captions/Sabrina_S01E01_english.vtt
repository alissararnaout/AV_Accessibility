00:00:08.956 --> 00:00:11.668
Just let me check
Her sixteenth birthday

00:00:11.669 --> 00:00:13.013
started five minutes ago.

00:00:14.951 --> 00:00:19.101
Oh look Hilda,
she's levitating right on schedule.

00:00:19.656 --> 00:00:21.254
Lets wake her up and tell her she's a witch.

00:00:21.445 --> 00:00:24.995
No. Let her sleep.
She starts her new school tomorrow

00:00:24.996 --> 00:00:28.237
besides the first levitation is so special.

00:00:28.272 --> 00:00:30.416
Yeah, but then it gets old real quick.

00:00:31.638 --> 00:00:33.761
I can't believe our
little niece is growing up.

00:00:33.762 --> 00:00:37.861
Wait till Sabrina finds out
what new doors this will open for her.

00:00:37.905 --> 00:00:40.976
Wait till she finds out you still get zits
when you're six hundred years old.

00:00:41.925 --> 00:00:43.803
Well we'd better go before she wakes up.

00:00:46.179 --> 00:00:51.190
So sweet, so innocent,
just the perfect little witch.

00:00:55.666 --> 00:00:58.666
1X01 "Pilot"
27-SEP-1996

00:01:16.739 --> 00:01:17.048
Morning.

00:01:17.150 --> 00:01:19.182
Good morning.
Happy birthday Sabrina.

00:01:19.462 --> 00:01:20.280
And many more to come.

00:01:20.485 --> 00:01:23.722
Many, many more to come.
I ah, got you a little something.

00:01:24.185 --> 00:01:27.435
Actually that's from both of us.
I just forgot to sign the card.

00:01:28.118 --> 00:01:29.331
I hope you don't already have one.

00:01:33.017 --> 00:01:36.972
A black pot?
Actually I don't. Thanks.

00:01:37.090 --> 00:01:38.014
It's a cauldron.

00:01:38.308 --> 00:01:42.028
Wow, even better.
I can um put my pens in it.

00:01:42.121 --> 00:01:45.604
That's not what it's for.
Sabrina, we have something to tell you.

00:01:45.893 --> 00:01:49.695
You see there are two realms,
the natural and the supernatural

00:01:49.938 --> 00:01:52.179
and it turns out the immutable laws of physics...
You're a witch.

00:01:53.630 --> 00:01:54.761
What do you mean, I'm a witch?

00:01:55.540 --> 00:01:56.128
You're a witch.

00:01:57.278 --> 00:02:01.111
Now you're not alone.
I'm a witch, Hilda's a witch, your father's a witch.

00:02:01.360 --> 00:02:03.055
And I suppose my mom's a witch too.

00:02:03.182 --> 00:02:04.138
I always thought so.

00:02:04.502 --> 00:02:07.454
Actually your mom's mortal.
You see that's why you're here,

00:02:07.786 --> 00:02:09.369
so that we can teach you to use your magic.

00:02:09.637 --> 00:02:10.917
You know for a second there

00:02:10.918 --> 00:02:14.300
you almost made me forget
about my first day at school. Thanks...

00:02:15.133 --> 00:02:19.761
but now I've got to go and catch a bus
to take me to my doom.

00:02:20.804 --> 00:02:21.773
Bye bye. Have fun.

00:02:21.997 --> 00:02:23.654
And don't make too many hand gestures.

00:02:23.655 --> 00:02:32.520
My aunts try hard, but you have to admit
they're pretty weird.

00:02:35.048 --> 00:02:37.681
You have no idea.

00:02:51.300 --> 00:02:53.511
Summer's over. Come on in.

00:02:54.905 --> 00:02:56.197
I'm Mr. Pool.

00:02:58.439 --> 00:02:59.789
And I know you
were hoping I was going to

00:02:59.790 --> 00:03:02.401
spend the day
mispronouncing your names but

00:03:02.555 --> 00:03:05.368
instead lets jump straight into biology huh?

00:03:06.107 --> 00:03:08.331
The frog is a
cold blooded vertebrate.

00:03:08.332 --> 00:03:11.422
As we dissect this
amphibian we'll be looking for...

00:03:11.871 --> 00:03:15.235
The kidney,
the heart and my lost youth.

00:03:15.236 --> 00:03:17.678
So if you'll each choose
up a lab partner.

00:03:20.523 --> 00:03:22.484
Or I could pair you off by height.

00:03:23.853 --> 00:03:24.439
Thank you.

00:03:24.440 --> 00:03:27.057
Hey, you want...
Harvey!

00:03:28.059 --> 00:03:28.983
I'll be your lab partner.

00:03:35.135 --> 00:03:37.641
Lets name him Tad,
Tad Pole.

00:03:38.471 --> 00:03:41.724
Okay.
Hey thanks for asking me to be your lab partner.

00:03:42.598 --> 00:03:44.814
I know what it's like,
I was the new kid last year.

00:03:45.932 --> 00:03:49.037
So, can I ask you a question?
Do you ever feel like you don't fit in?

00:03:49.861 --> 00:03:52.374
Only all the time but
I don't want to fit in.

00:03:52.375 --> 00:03:57.074
I researched it and awkward people
tend to be much more successful later in life.

00:03:57.520 --> 00:04:00.753
I look at... Libby,
I see tragedy.

00:04:01.476 --> 00:04:05.063
Oh look girls, you've
you've bored your frog to death.

00:04:05.858 --> 00:04:07.382
Well, slice and dice.

00:04:09.382 --> 00:04:10.728
Oh I hate doing this.

00:04:10.729 --> 00:04:13.015
If only there was some way
I could bring these frogs back to life.

00:04:13.657 --> 00:04:16.254
I think his heart is somewhere around... here.

00:04:18.072 --> 00:04:20.266
LOOK!
Tad's alive! How'd that happen?

00:04:20.660 --> 00:04:22.332
Ha-ha! It's Frankenfrog.

00:04:22.808 --> 00:04:26.166
Hey,
Mr. Pool. Ours is still kicking.

00:04:27.667 --> 00:04:30.210
Oh, Mike from Cadaver Shack's gonna hear from me.

00:04:31.214 --> 00:04:33.087
Can you believe how young the freshmen look?

00:04:35.710 --> 00:04:36.771
May we help you?

00:04:36.860 --> 00:04:39.629
I just wanted to wash my hands.
Y'know, frog juice.

00:04:43.488 --> 00:04:48.576
You know,
if you stink I'm not sure it's fair to blame the frog.

00:04:50.177 --> 00:04:52.282
Well at least I don't splash on aftershave

00:04:52.283 --> 00:04:54.379
to remind me of some boy
who dumped me last summer.

00:04:54.507 --> 00:04:55.501
How'd you know that?

00:04:58.454 --> 00:05:01.699
I don't know,
my incredible sense of smell told me?

00:05:03.423 --> 00:05:04.748
Huh! Yeah right.

00:05:05.040 --> 00:05:07.485
Well, I'd better get going.
Smell you later.

00:05:07.889 --> 00:05:15.646
Wait! Don't come in here again.
From now on you use the freaks bathroom.

00:05:31.161 --> 00:05:33.539
Hi, I'm home.
Where is everyone?

00:05:35.577 --> 00:05:36.722
Surprise!

00:05:37.073 --> 00:05:39.697
Oh look a party, sort of.

00:05:41.321 --> 00:05:45.360
Oh look, you put Salem in a little party hat,
that's so cute.

00:05:47.362 --> 00:05:49.458
Here is a present from your father.

00:05:52.372 --> 00:05:56.877
An old book? A black pot?
Doesn't anyone shop at The Gap anymore?

00:05:57.778 --> 00:06:00.514
'The Discovery of Magic'
Why'd he give me this?

00:06:02.804 --> 00:06:05.428
That's why! This old magician looks just like my dad.

00:06:06.296 --> 00:06:07.677
Surprise!

00:06:08.397 --> 00:06:11.775
It is your dad.
Happy birthday Sabrina.

00:06:12.456 --> 00:06:15.159
Wow! Hallmark has gone really high tech.
Can he say anything else?

00:06:15.160 --> 00:06:19.350
I'm not a hologram honey,
I'm just in a different realm.

00:06:19.351 --> 00:06:20.315
A different realm?

00:06:20.316 --> 00:06:22.714
I thought you were at the Toronto Midway Motor Lodge.

00:06:23.053 --> 00:06:26.575
Zelda! Hilda! Didn't you explain to her she's a witch?

00:06:26.576 --> 00:06:27.864
She doesn't believe us.

00:06:28.385 --> 00:06:29.192
Not this again.

00:06:29.925 --> 00:06:32.420
Look, I know you went
to a lot of trouble to set this joke up so

00:06:32.421 --> 00:06:33.998
ha-ha-ha. Now it's over.

00:06:34.356 --> 00:06:37.914
No. It's just beginning.
You are A witch.

00:06:37.915 --> 00:06:40.553
With real magical powers

00:06:40.554 --> 00:06:42.901
and now that your sixteen
you can use them.

00:06:43.021 --> 00:06:45.099
And you wanted something from The Gap.

00:06:45.100 --> 00:06:47.784
So what are you saying,
that I'm not who I think I am?

00:06:47.785 --> 00:06:50.769
You're not who I think you are?
And my father lives in a book?

00:06:51.397 --> 00:06:52.247
Oh finally she gets it.

00:06:52.248 --> 00:06:54.390
This is insane.
I'm going to my room.

00:06:54.391 --> 00:06:55.087
Come on Salem.

00:06:55.088 --> 00:06:58.159
Can you wait till I've finished my milk?

00:07:00.436 --> 00:07:01.779
Did the cat just talk?

00:07:01.780 --> 00:07:05.106
Yes,
and get this stupid hat of my head.

00:07:05.107 --> 00:07:05.766
Oh my God!

00:07:07.568 --> 00:07:10.894
I think we'd better let her father handle this.
Ted?

00:07:20.597 --> 00:07:22.216
Sabrina, open me up!
No!

00:07:22.964 --> 00:07:25.233
We have to talk young lady,
open me up this instant!

00:07:25.234 --> 00:07:28.890
No! I don't want to talk to a book.
Oh God, I'm talking to a book.

00:07:30.845 --> 00:07:31.925
I can't be a witch.

00:07:34.508 --> 00:07:35.780
Witches don't exist.

00:07:36.284 --> 00:07:39.246
Honey, I know this is hard
but you just have to accept it.

00:07:39.247 --> 00:07:41.819
You're not like other kids,
you're special.

00:07:41.820 --> 00:07:44.312
I don't wanna be special,
I wanna be normal.

00:07:44.313 --> 00:07:47.450
I understand,
but that ship has sailed.

00:07:47.761 --> 00:07:49.500
None of this makes sense.
I mean all these years

00:07:49.501 --> 00:07:51.413
I thought you were travelling with the Foreign Service.

00:07:51.746 --> 00:07:55.063
I am.
It's just a lot more foreign than you thought.

00:07:55.064 --> 00:07:58.387
And mom?
Has she really been digging for fossils in Peru?

00:07:58.388 --> 00:08:00.090
Yes she has.

00:08:00.091 --> 00:08:01.438
Then I wanna go live with her.

00:08:01.439 --> 00:08:04.118
You can't.
You see there's a rule.

00:08:04.119 --> 00:08:06.625
If you set eyes on your
mother in the next two years

00:08:06.626 --> 00:08:09.080
she'll turn into a ball of wax.

00:08:09.352 --> 00:08:09.923
What!

00:08:09.924 --> 00:08:12.635
It's the way they discourage
mortal-witch marriages.

00:08:12.636 --> 00:08:15.374
So is that the reason
you and mom got divorced?

00:08:15.375 --> 00:08:16.714
No.

00:08:16.715 --> 00:08:19.518
So d'ya think maybe you
could get back together?

00:08:19.519 --> 00:08:20.584
No.

00:08:20.585 --> 00:08:23.452
That's another ship that's sailed.

00:08:24.449 --> 00:08:25.509
You 're going to be fine.

00:08:25.510 --> 00:08:28.773
Just take some time
and think about all this

00:08:28.858 --> 00:08:33.099
and if you ever need me,
I'm in the index.

00:08:36.936 --> 00:08:39.244
I call.
Five aces.

00:08:39.245 --> 00:08:39.966
You cheat!

00:08:39.967 --> 00:08:40.682
Do not.

00:08:40.683 --> 00:08:41.405
Do too!

00:08:41.406 --> 00:08:42.313
Do not!
Okay.

00:08:44.076 --> 00:08:46.189
I've talked to my dad
and I've thought about it

00:08:46.190 --> 00:08:48.966
and I guess I believe I'm a witch.

00:08:48.967 --> 00:08:50.574
Good,
because you are.

00:08:51.488 --> 00:08:55.074
Okay. You know what?
Let's try some magic.

00:08:55.075 --> 00:08:57.449
Sabrina, you stand right there,
Hilda you stay there.

00:08:57.925 --> 00:08:59.307
Alright,
let's start with the basics.

00:08:59.308 --> 00:09:03.068
Orange into apple.
Now you concentrate and point.

00:09:03.069 --> 00:09:04.510
Come on, try it.

00:09:12.182 --> 00:09:14.047
Apple,
pineapple.

00:09:14.048 --> 00:09:15.194
That's very close.

00:09:15.195 --> 00:09:16.602
No it's not.

00:09:17.073 --> 00:09:18.152
Let's try again.

00:09:25.200 --> 00:09:26.418
I'm not very good at this.

00:09:26.419 --> 00:09:28.714
You told me the
twenty-third time was the charm.

00:09:28.715 --> 00:09:30.604
You'll learn to control your magic.

00:09:30.605 --> 00:09:34.257
Or at the very least,
you'll always be able to garnish a ham steak.

00:09:35.012 --> 00:09:35.848
One more try.

00:09:37.828 --> 00:09:39.474
Salem into apple.

00:09:39.475 --> 00:09:41.606
I think that's enough for one night.

00:09:41.607 --> 00:09:44.012
The cat's right,
wrap it up.

00:09:44.013 --> 00:09:45.275
You've got school tomorrow.

00:09:45.455 --> 00:09:47.350
I'm a witch and I still
have to go to school?

00:09:47.351 --> 00:09:48.872
Hm-hm.
Unfair.

00:09:48.997 --> 00:09:51.074
Hey, maybe I'll turn Mr. Pool into...

00:09:51.383 --> 00:09:54.383
Now! Now! Be careful pointing your finger at people,

00:09:53.383 --> 00:09:55.019
it could be dangerous.

00:09:55.020 --> 00:09:55.923
You're pointing at me.

00:09:56.248 --> 00:09:57.463
I have the safety on.

00:10:03.882 --> 00:10:04.604
Aw!

00:10:08.923 --> 00:10:10.282
Morning.
Morning.

00:10:10.283 --> 00:10:11.018
Pineapple?

00:10:11.019 --> 00:10:12.166
You're going to be late.

00:10:12.167 --> 00:10:14.738
So? I'm a witch.
Can't I just turn back time?

00:10:14.739 --> 00:10:18.783
U-uh! No, a witch can't change time.
That's one of the rules.

00:10:18.784 --> 00:10:19.373
You're kidding?
No.

00:10:19.794 --> 00:10:20.414
Gotta go!

00:10:20.934 --> 00:10:22.622
You also can't get rid of cellulite.

00:10:24.431 --> 00:10:25.147
Hey, I got a joke.

00:10:25.960 --> 00:10:26.709
Knock knock.

00:10:27.012 --> 00:10:28.414
Who's there?
Brad.

00:10:28.608 --> 00:10:29.067
Brad who?

00:10:29.718 --> 00:10:32.069
Brad Pitt.
Is there any other Brad worth mentioning?

00:10:33.855 --> 00:10:36.180
Thank you for coming.
Did you enjoy that pop quiz?

00:10:37.477 --> 00:10:39.873
I am so bad at history.

00:10:39.874 --> 00:10:42.057
Me too. I mean how are we supposed to
remember things that happened so long ago?

00:10:42.058 --> 00:10:43.965
Heads up!

00:10:44.622 --> 00:10:46.968
Watch it with the football!
Are you okay?

00:10:46.969 --> 00:10:49.420
Try to live in this world,
not just your own.

00:10:57.255 --> 00:10:58.601
Can I sit here?
Sure.

00:11:00.373 --> 00:11:03.659
How's your head?
Um, it kinda hurts.

00:11:03.660 --> 00:11:06.668
Sorry, y'know
I didn't mean to hit you with the football.

00:11:06.669 --> 00:11:07.569
Oh, that was you?

00:11:09.102 --> 00:11:10.791
You have a really good arm.
Thanks.

00:11:12.170 --> 00:11:13.260
Oh, do you know Jenny?

00:11:13.982 --> 00:11:16.013
You live in the house with the funny mailbox right?

00:11:17.049 --> 00:11:17.987
It's not our fault.

00:11:18.022 --> 00:11:22.112
The people who lived there before us
were actually named Mr. and Mr.s Hog.

00:11:22.869 --> 00:11:27.289
No, it's cute. My mailbox is boring,
it's really just a place to put letters.

00:11:27.864 --> 00:11:28.621
Mine too!

00:11:30.700 --> 00:11:31.240
Hi Harvey.

00:11:32.688 --> 00:11:34.492
I'm having a party Saturday night,
you'll be there right?

00:11:34.578 --> 00:11:36.579
Sure,
I'm not doing anything else.

00:11:36.908 --> 00:11:38.962
Perfect.
Everyone cools coming.

00:11:41.554 --> 00:11:42.668
Well that's all.

00:11:45.143 --> 00:11:48.096
Oh-no.
Smell you later.

00:11:48.207 --> 00:11:49.501
You did that on purpose!

00:11:50.167 --> 00:11:50.800
Prove it.

00:11:51.375 --> 00:11:54.864
Don't walk away! I mean it,
I've not done talking with you!

00:11:58.531 --> 00:12:00.672
TWISTER!
EVERYBODY HIT THE DECK!

00:12:13.195 --> 00:12:14.013
Where did Libby go?

00:12:15.927 --> 00:12:16.762
I have no idea.

00:12:24.516 --> 00:12:28.552
There's a lecture at MIT on the
Heisenberg Uncertainty Principle.

00:12:29.452 --> 00:12:31.418
'It's either at eight or at ten.'

00:12:32.633 --> 00:12:33.957
I hate being a witch!

00:12:33.958 --> 00:12:37.861
I've just turned the most popular
girl in school into a pineapple.

00:12:38.020 --> 00:12:40.357
Why?
Because it's the only thing you taught me how to do.

00:12:40.358 --> 00:12:42.911
Chill,
I can fix this.

00:12:45.276 --> 00:12:46.778
Chunks
or rings?

00:12:46.779 --> 00:12:48.857
Hilda! There are other ways.

00:12:49.202 --> 00:12:49.963
Wedges?

00:12:49.964 --> 00:12:53.329
Sabrina doesn't know
how to seal her spells yet, so...

00:12:55.513 --> 00:12:57.969
The popular girl is not a fruit.

00:13:00.421 --> 00:13:02.019
There, all better.

00:13:02.791 --> 00:13:04.899
What am I doing in your house?

00:13:06.030 --> 00:13:07.273
You came over for a visit.

00:13:08.449 --> 00:13:12.227
I would not.
You did something to me

00:13:12.227 --> 00:13:14.070
you sent me somewhere.

00:13:15.697 --> 00:13:17.340
It was small and it smelled like Hawaii.

00:13:17.987 --> 00:13:21.857
Look Libby, I'm sorry I didn't...
Oh not as sorry as you will be.

00:13:21.858 --> 00:13:26.044
You're an even bigger freak than I thought
and the whole school's going to know about it.

00:13:28.406 --> 00:13:30.254
See? My way,
she'd be on a tooth-pick.

00:13:31.059 --> 00:13:32.042
It's over!

00:13:32.894 --> 00:13:35.426
My life is over!
I mean it's not just over,

00:13:35.427 --> 00:13:36.378
it's over, over!

00:13:36.986 --> 00:13:42.812
Oh stop, Libby can't hurt you.
She's just one person with a crazy story.

00:13:42.813 --> 00:13:45.526
She's a cheerleader,
nobody has more credibility.

00:13:46.674 --> 00:13:47.952
I mean the only way to make this better

00:13:47.953 --> 00:13:50.118
is to turn back time and
you said a witch can't do that.

00:13:50.179 --> 00:13:51.543
A witch can't

00:13:51.544 --> 00:13:54.798
but collectively we do have
powers that a single witch doesn't.

00:13:55.005 --> 00:13:56.759
It's a union thing.

00:13:57.640 --> 00:13:58.690
So it's possible?

00:13:59.284 --> 00:14:00.347
You can appeal to the Witches Council

00:14:00.348 --> 00:14:03.252
but they only grant time
reversal in extreme cases.

00:14:03.278 --> 00:14:06.085
Like for two months
a bunny ruled all of England.

00:14:06.086 --> 00:14:06.937
When?

00:14:06.938 --> 00:14:07.526
See?

00:14:09.029 --> 00:14:11.261
Well how do I get to this Witches Council?

00:14:11.262 --> 00:14:13.226
It's ten million light-years away,

00:14:13.870 --> 00:14:15.579
But there's a short cut through our linen closet.

00:14:15.580 --> 00:14:18.184
Now the head of the
council is named Drell.

00:14:18.185 --> 00:14:21.107
He's a mean, pigheaded,
power mad despot.

00:14:21.142 --> 00:14:24.242
We used to date.
I haven't seen him in centuries.

00:14:24.243 --> 00:14:26.123
Not since he left her at the alter.

00:14:26.124 --> 00:14:28.908
Daddy lost a huge deposit
on the Parthenon.

00:14:29.062 --> 00:14:31.418
Would you let that go?
It's ancient history.

00:14:31.419 --> 00:14:32.525
I knew the trouble you were getting...

00:14:32.526 --> 00:14:34.616
I didn't even want that
big wedding with the long...

00:14:35.366 --> 00:14:37.690
Excuse me! I'm trying to turn
back time here. Can we go?

00:14:37.946 --> 00:14:42.415
Oh-no! I couldn't. I swore I would never
talk to Drell again as long as he lived.

00:14:42.416 --> 00:14:45.230
Besides, the Council will respect you more if you go alone.

00:14:45.231 --> 00:14:48.260
Now make a left at the towels and follow the signs.

00:14:48.465 --> 00:14:49.783
And watch out for Drell.

00:14:49.784 --> 00:14:51.813
And whatever you do, don't stare at his mole!

00:14:57.624 --> 00:14:59.181
Sorry, is this the Witches Council?

00:14:59.531 --> 00:15:02.292
Yes. I don't believe you have an appointment.

00:15:06.359 --> 00:15:08.157
Drell, did you remember to feed the candle?

00:15:10.792 --> 00:15:12.145
There, happy?

00:15:13.506 --> 00:15:17.269
Er, I know I don't have an appointment
but I um I brought a wash cloth.

00:15:20.751 --> 00:15:24.890
Okay, state your name, age and request,
we'll see if we can fit you in.

00:15:24.891 --> 00:15:27.197
I'm Sabrina, I'm sixteen and I'd like to turn back time.

00:15:27.198 --> 00:15:27.888
Denied!

00:15:29.875 --> 00:15:31.729
Well we fit you in.
Next order of business...

00:15:35.039 --> 00:15:35.986
Are you staring at my mole?

00:15:37.263 --> 00:15:40.233
No! I just didn't get a chance to explain
why I wanted to turn back time.

00:15:40.897 --> 00:15:41.799
Let's humour her.

00:15:41.838 --> 00:15:44.413
Okay. Speak!
But quickly.

00:15:45.301 --> 00:15:46.462
Okay, where do I start?

00:15:47.186 --> 00:15:49.707
Y'know from the moment I started my new school

00:15:49.708 --> 00:15:52.069
I didn't fit in. I wore the wrong shoes,

00:15:52.104 --> 00:15:54.628
which may seem like nothing
but kids can be so judgmental...

00:15:54.629 --> 00:15:56.338
I said quickly!

00:16:03.559 --> 00:16:05.069
And frankly it's hard enough knowing you really

00:16:05.070 --> 00:16:07.328
are a freak without everyone else knowing it too.

00:16:07.714 --> 00:16:10.675
Oh the problems of teenagers are so interesting.

00:16:11.149 --> 00:16:13.494
Well we'll review your case
and then we'll get back to you.

00:16:13.495 --> 00:16:14.506
But I need to know.

00:16:14.507 --> 00:16:16.423
And you will!
Now go,

00:16:16.424 --> 00:16:19.549
and don't let the time-space
continuum hit you on the way out.

00:16:22.155 --> 00:16:24.117
You love me don't you, huh Moley?

00:16:30.215 --> 00:16:32.386
Salem, d'ya think the Council
will grant the time reversal?

00:16:32.387 --> 00:16:35.724
I'm the wrong witch to ask
they weren't very lenient with me.

00:16:35.725 --> 00:16:39.709
Sentenced to a hundred years
as a cat, and for what?

00:16:39.710 --> 00:16:41.439
I don't know, for what?

00:16:41.440 --> 00:16:45.146
Oh like any young kid I dreamed of world domination

00:16:45.147 --> 00:16:48.399
course they really crack down
when you act upon it.

00:16:48.400 --> 00:16:51.226
Wow! No wonder you're
so possessive of the sofa.

00:16:51.227 --> 00:16:54.230
Hmm. It would have been glorious. Me,

00:16:54.231 --> 00:16:57.365
as the firm but just Emperor of Earth.

00:16:57.366 --> 00:17:01.187
Trust me, being a house pet
wasn't even plan 'B'

00:17:01.188 --> 00:17:03.835
Come on, it's not that bad.
You take five thousand naps a day.

00:17:03.836 --> 00:17:05.241
I can't go dancing

00:17:05.242 --> 00:17:06.821
I can't play squash.

00:17:06.822 --> 00:17:12.265
The sound of the can-opener
is the only thing that makes me feel truly alive.

00:17:13.001 --> 00:17:16.600
Salem, would you like your rubber mouse?

00:17:17.492 --> 00:17:18.591
Please.

00:17:21.913 --> 00:17:23.702
Any word from the Witches Council?

00:17:23.703 --> 00:17:26.439
Not yet and if I'm going to school
I have to leave any second.

00:17:27.960 --> 00:17:28.665
That's it.

00:17:28.666 --> 00:17:29.205
That's it?

00:17:29.206 --> 00:17:30.569
Careful, don't burn your fingers.

00:17:31.872 --> 00:17:34.773
Please! Please! Please! Please!
Request denied! Ha-ha-ha.

00:17:36.089 --> 00:17:37.556
I'm sorry honey.

00:17:38.580 --> 00:17:39.473
It's okay.

00:17:39.474 --> 00:17:41.989
So, where are we moving?
I hear Greenland's a groove.

00:17:42.024 --> 00:17:43.966
Get your books, you're going to be late.

00:17:43.967 --> 00:17:46.303
You don't understand. aunt Hilda,
I'm not going to school.

00:17:46.304 --> 00:17:48.819
Oh yes you are.
You can do this.

00:17:48.820 --> 00:17:50.942
You can't go through life
being afraid of things.

00:17:50.943 --> 00:17:52.172
Toughen up.

00:17:52.595 --> 00:17:53.934
But everyone'll laugh at me.

00:17:54.425 --> 00:17:55.199
Toughen up.

00:17:55.200 --> 00:17:57.922
So that's my choice?
Toughen up or toughen up?

00:17:57.923 --> 00:17:59.507
Aunt Zelda, will you help me?

00:17:59.508 --> 00:18:02.435
Oh you know I hate to say it but
aunt Hilda's right.

00:18:02.876 --> 00:18:04.981
I mean who cares
what the other kids say?

00:18:06.884 --> 00:18:10.070
Actually Libby thought
I was a freak even before this happened.

00:18:10.071 --> 00:18:11.006
See?

00:18:12.791 --> 00:18:18.948
Fine, I surrender.
I guess every school needs a weird kid,

00:18:18.949 --> 00:18:20.430
it might as well be me.

00:18:20.431 --> 00:18:21.897
I was the weird kid!

00:18:25.307 --> 00:18:27.573
They don't tar and feather anymore do they?

00:18:27.574 --> 00:18:28.742
I hated that.

00:18:28.743 --> 00:18:31.823
You know who's fault this is?
That jerk Drell's

00:18:33.127 --> 00:18:36.823
Just a thought but I bet you could
convince him to change his mind.

00:18:36.824 --> 00:18:42.028
Me! I don't think so. Besides,
Sabrina's going to be fine.

00:18:42.029 --> 00:18:46.355
Yes, she'll be ostracised
and reviled but she'll get over it.

00:18:46.356 --> 00:18:49.958
The wounds will heal,
the scars will fade...

00:18:49.959 --> 00:18:52.735
You know I can't face Drell!

00:18:54.161 --> 00:18:55.550
Toughen up!

00:18:56.294 --> 00:19:00.120
It's payback time Drell.
I'm coming in.

00:19:04.980 --> 00:19:09.070
Hilda! What are you doing here?
Oh, get your hands off my mole!

00:19:10.749 --> 00:19:13.638
Hey, I've got a joke.
Knock knock.

00:19:13.639 --> 00:19:14.396
Who's there?

00:19:14.397 --> 00:19:15.345
Brad.

00:19:15.346 --> 00:19:17.476
Brad Pitt?
You told me that joke yesterday.

00:19:17.477 --> 00:19:19.916
No I didn't,
I just heard it on the bus.

00:19:23.274 --> 00:19:23.996
Really?

00:19:24.919 --> 00:19:26.331
Excellent work Sabrina.

00:19:27.830 --> 00:19:29.837
I cannot believe you aced the pop quiz!

00:19:29.838 --> 00:19:32.340
Well what can I say,
I just love History.

00:19:32.341 --> 00:19:34.763
'Heads up'

00:19:40.151 --> 00:19:41.742
Can I sit here?
Sure.

00:19:42.591 --> 00:19:45.257
That was a great catch.
I was in the zone.

00:19:45.258 --> 00:19:46.470
D'you know Jenny?

00:19:46.471 --> 00:19:48.535
You live in the house
with the funny mailbox right?

00:19:48.536 --> 00:19:49.830
You know,
before we get into that.

00:19:49.831 --> 00:19:51.683
If you're not doing anything Saturday night

00:19:51.684 --> 00:19:53.396
would you like to come
and see a movie with Jenny and me?

00:19:53.397 --> 00:19:55.580
Well sure,
that sounds like fun. Cool.

00:19:56.219 --> 00:19:58.218
Cool.
Cool.

00:19:58.219 --> 00:20:00.014
So you were saying about mailboxes?

00:20:00.015 --> 00:20:03.134
Hi Harvey.
I'm having a party Saturday night,

00:20:03.135 --> 00:20:03.971
you'll be there right?

00:20:03.972 --> 00:20:06.119
Sorry, I just made plans.

00:20:06.949 --> 00:20:10.882
Oh, bubble burst, and I bet
you wanted everyone cool to come.

00:20:23.919 --> 00:20:25.405
I love being a witch!

00:20:25.406 --> 00:20:27.386
I don't know what made
the Council change their minds

00:20:27.387 --> 00:20:29.877
but I got to do the whole day over again.

00:20:29.878 --> 00:20:33.093
And now the teachers think I'm smart,
the jocks think I'm cool.

00:20:33.094 --> 00:20:35.985
Oh and I'm going to the movies
with Harvey and Jenny Saturday night.

00:20:35.986 --> 00:20:38.254
Woo-hoo! I'm normal!
Gotta go tell the cat.

00:20:40.777 --> 00:20:42.814
Teens.
What about them?

00:20:43.388 --> 00:20:44.355
Just in general.

00:20:46.828 --> 00:20:49.493
Salem, I don't play squash
but how about a dance?

00:20:58.677 --> 00:21:01.449
And once I controlled Eurasia
I was going to advance on...

00:21:01.450 --> 00:21:05.098
Oh Salem, can you hold that thought.

00:21:05.099 --> 00:21:06.694
I'll be right back,
I've gotta get some more milk.

00:21:06.695 --> 00:21:10.732
Stay where you are.
You're a witch, look under the M's

00:21:13.554 --> 00:21:15.117
Wow! Magic milk.

00:21:20.211 --> 00:21:23.194
Cool, It worked. Hey,
I could get used to this magic.

00:21:24.423 --> 00:21:25.701
Hey, share.
